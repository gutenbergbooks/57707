<p class='c010'>In the following narrative an attempt is made to forecast the course of events
preliminary and incidental to the Great War which, in the opinion of military
and political experts, will probably occur in the immediate future. The writers,
who are well-known authorities on international politics and strategy, have
striven to derive material for their description of the conflict from the best
sources, to conceive the most probable campaigns and acts of policy, and generally
to give to their work the verisimilitude and actuality of real warfare.</p>

<p class='c011'>A report has been current here since a late hour last evening,
to the effect that an attempt has been made to assassinate Prince
Ferdinand of Bulgaria, at a mining town named Samakoff, about
forty miles south of Sofia. It is said that the Prince, who had
been shooting in the Balabancha Balkans, was driving into
Samakoff towards evening yesterday, when his carriage was
stopped, and he was attacked by a number of men armed with
knives and pistols. The Prince’s attendants succeeded in saving
their master’s life and in beating off some and capturing others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of his assailants, but not before His Highness had been severely
wounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prince Ferdinand was carried into the house of an American
missionary resident in Samakoff, where he now lies. His Highness’s
condition is serious, and is rendered the more critical from
the fact that there is no very adequate surgical aid obtainable in
Samakoff, and it was necessary to telegraph for doctors to Sofia
and Philippopolis.</p>

<p class='c011'>The greatest excitement reigns in Constantinople since the
receipt of this intelligence, and very grave anxiety is expressed
in diplomatic circles as to the possible consequences of this terrible
misfortune.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Editorial Comments.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>It is impossible to overrate the grave significance of this
attempted assassination at Samakoff, which in the light of our
Correspondent’s telegrams would seem to be the prelude to very
serious complications in the East. It is, of course, too early to
estimate its influence upon general European politics, but we are
quite within reason in saying that the dramatic incident may
prove to have endangered the peace of Europe. We have long
familiarised ourselves with the thought that the Great War of
which the world has been in constant dread for some years back,
and which is to re-adjust the balance of the Continent, is much
more likely to break out in the region of the Danube than on the
banks of the Rhine, and the incident at Samakoff may well precipitate
the catastrophe. The situation is most perilous, and it
is to be hoped that strenuous endeavours will be made by the
Powers to chain up the ‘dogs of war,’ and spare this dying
century, at least, the spectacle of their release. Since the Treaty
of Berlin patched up the last serious disturbance in Europe,
there has been peace; peace, it is true; but a peace subject to
perpetual menace, and weighty matter for the consideration of
statesmen. Europe has lived, as it were, in armed camps, neutral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and watchful; and all the time the nations have prepared against
war as though war were at their doors. The dastardly outrage
at Samakoff comes at a sorry time.</p>

<p class='c011'>For we repeat our firm conviction, based on long and close
attention to the political motives at work among the nations, that
it is on the Danube and not on the Rhine that the torch of war
will first be kindled. To a pessimist, indeed, if not to an unbiassed
observer, we may well seem of late to have been drawing nearer
and nearer to a general war. The world has never been afflicted
with more persistent rumours of war. No single day has passed
without bringing us its perturbing crop of tremors and apprehensions
about the stability of the European peace. From week to week
the Jewish speculators on all the Bourses of Christendom have
been robbed of their sleep, and, worse still, of their dividends, by
telegrams as to the secret massing of troops on this or that frontier,
and of ruinous uprisings in various subject and down-trodden
countries. Now it is the Black Sea Treaty that is going to be
forcibly robbed of its entire Dardanelles clauses, and again the
Bargain of Berlin is about to be perforated, for the sixth time, by
the sword-point of the Czar. Then the Roumanians wake up to find
the Russians beginning to hem them in on three sides; while, again,
newspaper readers are horrified by a revelation of the rapacious
passions which some dignify by the title of ‘principle of nationality,’
and others denounce as criminal ‘lust of land,’ that are on the
verge of outbreak at Athens and Sofia, at St. Petersburg, at
Belgrade, at Vienna, at Paris, and even at Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where is the wisdom of highly-placed men like the German
Emperor and his new Chancellor assuring the world, in addresses
from the throne and after-dinner speeches, that the peace of Europe
was never more assured than at present, and that the political
horizon is without a cloud even of the size of Elijah’s ominous and
initial speck of vapour? What is the truth or the wisdom of such
assurances, when the thorn of Alsace-Lorraine is still sticking in
the flesh of the unforgiving and revengeful French; when Italy
still has some territory ‘unredeemed;’ when Denmark still harbours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>a deep grudge against her truculent despoiler; when even the peaceful
Swedes, who are still animated by the spirit of the Great Gustavus,
long to free their former subjects, the Finns, from the tyrannical
mastery of the Russians; when the Spaniards would gladly profit by
a European complication—even if they shrank from the thought of
an audacious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>—to repossess themselves of Gibraltar;
when the Portuguese, following suit, would never hesitate to kick
their British rival in Africa, if they deemed him to be down; when
the Cretans, egged on by the Greeks, are firmly resolved to throw
off the galling yoke of the Turks; when ex-ministers like M.
Tricoupis stump about the Balkan Peninsula, openly preaching
Pan-hellenism and Balkan Federation against the advocates of
disunited nationalities; when the Servians secretly vow to settle
up old scores with their Bulgarian vanquishers, and when these
Bulgarian victors themselves, with their Prime Minister more than
their Prince at their head, are sternly determined to be free and
independent alike of Sultan and of Czar; when Austria continues
to cast longing eyes in the direction of Salonika; and when, above
all things, the Colossus of the North, with his head pillowed on
snow, and his feet swathed in flowers of the sunny South, has
sworn by the soul of his assassinated and sainted father that he
will ever remain true to the intention of his sire in exacting a
solid equivalent of power, prestige, and territorial foothold on the
Balkan Peninsula for all the blood and treasure spent by Russia in
the task of ‘liberating’ the Bulgarians; when all these things, all
these slumbering passions and meditated schemes of aggression
and revenge are duly considered, how is it possible for any one, be
he sovereign or subject, to lull the world asleep by false assurances
of peace which is sooner or later doomed to be broken?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Triple Alliance will no more succeed in terrorising the
souls of all these secret plotters and designers, and in giving them
pause, than three inter-locked mountain oaks or firs could stay the
downward course of an extended series of separate avalanches, which
rend away with them pines, and oaks, and all, in their resistless
rush. But has the avalanche, which we thus dread, really and truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>at last begun to move? We sincerely trust not, but for the present
at least, the omens in the East have an exceedingly ugly and
alarming look, and we shall await the arrival of further telegrams
with the greatest anxiety. The Triple Alliance is not an embankment
that can bar the advancing flood of war, but rather a detached
fortress which must itself soon incur the danger of being surrounded
and even submerged by the rushing, whirling waters of
European strife. Though the parties to this three-cornered pact
have agreed to place their fire-engines, so to speak, at each other’s
disposal in the event of external danger from fire to their respective
domiciles, it is beyond the reach of these Powers to prevent the
outbreak of a conflagration, from accident or arson, among the
rickety, wind-swept, and thatch-roofed mansions of their neighbours;
nor is there any fact better established in connection with
fires than that they are used by thieves and anarchists for the
purpose of sudden plunder and disorder, at once upon the persons
and property of the victims and beholders of such catastrophes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us suppose, for example, that as a consequence of this most
alarming incident at Samakoff, hostilities should ensue between
Russia and Austria, the former being the aggressor. In that case
Germany—in virtue of her published Treaty with the Hapsburg
Monarchy—would almost immediately have to take the field.
Now, in such a contingency, is there not a grave danger that
France, seizing the golden opportunity for which she has so long
been waiting, would at once mobilise her army, and march the
greater part of it towards the Rhine? And is it not certain that
the immediate result of such a revengeful step on her part would
be that Italy, true likewise to her Treaty engagement with
Germany, would make haste to spring upon the flank of the
Republic?</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not well to forecast evils, but at the same time it is well
to look clearly ahead. We know surely enough the real nature of
the feelings with which the Bulgarians are regarded by their
‘Liberators,’ just as we are equally cognisant of the true character
of those who profess to be the Sultan’s ‘friends,’ and who, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>privilege of most intimate amity, have repeatedly helped themselves
to disintegrating slices of his dominions. We need not remind our
readers of that<a id='t6'></a> bitterness which still rankles in the breasts of the
Roumanians at the memory of the manner in which they were
‘rewarded’ for services rendered at the Gravitza Redoubt and
elsewhere during the war against the Turks; a bitterness which was
only equalled by the rage of the Russians when they recognised
the supreme folly of their conduct in forcing Roumania to accept
the Dobrudja in exchange for Bessarabia, and thus depriving themselves
of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied à terre</span></i> and strategical base of operations south of
the Danube, in the direction of the grand goal of their ultimate
ambition—the Golden Horn. It is as much the desire of Russia
to undo this unfortunate bargain as it is to shake herself free from
the intolerable shackles that restrain her liberty of action in the
Black Sea, and seal up the outlets thereof against her ships of war.
Russia is only awaiting a proper opportunity for accomplishing
these two other stages in what she deems to be her destiny (and
does not everything come to him who can wait?) just as she continues
to pursue her anti-English policy in Central Asia with steady,
disdainful, unresisted strides, ever lessening the distance between
her own frontiers and those of India, and thus paving the way for
the execution of her policy of preventing the forces of England
from being thrown into the balance should any complication arise
in the East of Europe. ‘And ever,’ as Tennyson sang, ‘upon the
topmost roof the banner of England blew;’ but that proud banner
has now, at last, been blown away by Cossack colonels from the
topmost roof of all—the ‘Roof of the World’ itself, thus enabling
Russia to overpeer our very Indian plains, and thence despatch her
Calebs and her Joshuas to spy out this other land of promise.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be quite true—and, indeed, from all we know of the
character of the Czar, we think it is quite true—that Alexander III.
has a holy horror of war, into which he is determined not to plunge
his people; and we have been assured by the greatest master of
modern war, the late Count Moltke, that the period of dynastic
conflicts, or struggles resulting from the personal passions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>petulance of rulers, has come to an end, and been succeeded by
wars between peoples and nations. This is also quite true; but it
is precisely herein that the greatest danger lurks. For a ruler—as
witness the case of the present Czar’s own father—may prove
too weak to restrain or deflect the set of the popular tide, and he
plunged into a war against his own will. It is also conceivable
that the French Government might find it impossible to resist the
clamours of the Chamber to embrace the first opportunity—and
what could be a better one than a general European conflagration?
for ousting the English from Egypt—an object which all good
Frenchmen deeply have at heart. But it is on the Balkan
Peninsula, where there are no rulers or restraining influences to
speak of, that popular passions and aspirations must enjoy most
unbridled sway; and therefore it is that we look with anxiety for
the further development of this tragic event at Samakoff, which
has already thrown the Balkan countries into a state of wild
excitement, and all Europe into a fit of ever-increasing alarm.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Philippopolis</span>, <em>April 4</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>(<em>Sunday Night.</em>) I date this message from Philippopolis,
whence indeed it will be despatched on our arrival there to-morrow;
but, as a matter of fact, it is written in the sleeping car of
a special train by which I am travelling to Ichtiman <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> for
Samakoff, in company with Drs. Patterson, Stekoulis, and Lelongt,
who have been invited by telegraph to meet their Bulgarian colleagues
in consultation at the bedside of the wounded Prince.
It is to these gentlemen’s courtesy that I owe the privilege of my
passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am enabled, by the kindness of my friends at the United
States Legation, which, as is natural in the circumstances, has
received minute information as to the occurrence, to give you a
fuller and more authentic account of the Samakoff tragedy of
yesterday by which Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria so nearly lost
his life, than is likely to have been transmitted as yet, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>which no doubt garbled first reports have already thrown consternation
into every European capital. I have already stated that it
is in the house of an American missionary that Prince Ferdinand
is at present lying. I must now explain that Samakoff, which is
nestled in the heart of a picturesque valley formed by the rough
triangle of the Kilo Dagh, the Kadir Tèré, and the De mir Kapou
Dagh at the head of the Balabancha range of Balkans, is not only
one of the wealthiest towns in the principality,—thanks to the iron
mines by which it is surrounded,—but is also famous and dear to
Bulgarians by reason of the presence there of the American
Mission School, whose principals rendered such devoted and signal
service to the oppressed Christians throughout the terrible time
of the massacres of 1876 and the war of 1877. At that time, when,
as will be remembered, to be a Bulgarian was all-sufficient reason
for being summarily hanged (if a man), or foully outraged (if a
woman), the principal of the school and his courageous wife
snatched many victims from the gallows, and rescued from a
terrible fate, by harbouring in the mission-house, numerous young
girls and children, fugitives from the devastated villages of the
Balkan slopes. And when brighter days dawned for Bulgaria,
and it became a principality, the services of the American Mission
at Samakoff were not forgotten. It became a custom, inaugurated
by Prince Alexander and studiously maintained by his successor,
for the Ruler of Bulgaria to visit Samakoff in an informal manner
once or twice a year, for the purpose of inspecting the mission
school and complimenting its directors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The snows which have held Samakoff isolated from the rest of
the world throughout the past four months, are now just melted,
and thus it chanced that Prince Ferdinand, who for a week past had
been shooting in the hills around Philippopolis, decided to pay his
first visit of the year to the missionaries of Samakoff, and had, unfortunately
as it turns out, announced his intention of so doing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Prince, with this purpose in view, left Philippopolis on
Friday evening, passing the night in his sleeping-car, and yesterday
morning started in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calèche</span></i> from Ichtiman-i-Vakarel, formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the boundary between Bulgaria and the province of Eastern
Roumelia, to drive to the little township in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>His Highness has usually been accompanied on these visits by
one or other of the ministers, but on this occasion, owing partly,
no doubt, to his hurriedly-formed plans, he had with him only one
of the aides-de-camp who had been of the shooting-party. The
Prince’s carriage was preceded by half-a-dozen mounted guards,
and followed by a like number, as an escort. This is a precaution
which Prince Ferdinand’s advisers have prevailed with him, much
against his will, to adopt of late, in view of the renewed activity
of Russian agents and sedition-mongers throughout the Principality
and the neighbouring States, where, indeed, a great anti-Bulgarian
and anti-Turkish propaganda has been actively carried on for the
past year; and in view also of the growing apprehension of his
advisers that the recent success in this city of assassins in Russian
pay, coupled with the immunity from punishment which the
Czar’s representatives have shown their ability and readiness to
secure for them, would prompt the conspirators, soon or late, to
fly at higher game than either M. Stambuloff or the late Dr.
Vulkovitch. That his Highness’s advisers were in the right has
been proved by the attempt of yesterday. The event, however,
may be said to offer encouragement at once to would-be regicides
and to their intended victims, inasmuch as it has been shown yet
once again to the former, how useless as a protection against
assassins is the presence of an armed escort, and to the latter, how
apt is a well-matured plot to be frustrated by a commonplace
accident.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Prince’s carriage was expected to reach Samakoff about
noon, and shortly before that hour a considerable number of
persons had collected in the main street, while small crowds had
gathered round the gates of the Prefecture and about the door of
the American Mission-house, which is situated in a side street
leading off the high road, and where the usual modest preparations
had been made for the princely visit.</p>

<p class='c011'>His Highness, on arrival, after halting for a moment or two at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the gate of the Prefecture where he did not alight, drove on
through the town towards the Mission-house. At the moment
when the carriage turned the corner into the narrower street, a
man wearing the long black gown and brimless stovepipe hat of a
priest of the orthodox church stood forward from the crowd, in
which were several other persons dressed as he was, and, raising a
revolver, took deliberate aim at his Highness. And then occurred
the accident to which, in all probability, Prince Ferdinand owes
his life. The cartridge did not explode. The sham priest lowered
his weapon slightly, raised it once more, and again pulled the
trigger; but as he did so the pistol barrel was struck up—the ball
burying itself in the wall of a house across the street—and the
assassin was seized and firmly held by many willing hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole occurrence had taken but a moment. The Prince,
when he saw the pistol levelled at him, had leapt to his feet, with
the evident intention of throwing himself upon his murderer.
As it was, his Highness’s intervention seemed very necessary on
behalf of the baffled assassin, who stood in no small danger of
being lynched incontinently by his furious captors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carriage had stopped; the escort was hastily dismounting,
and the Prince, shouting orders to the people to spare their
prisoner’s life, had alighted, and turning, was in the act of throwing
his heavy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pelisse</span> to his companion, when sudden as thought a
second ruffian sprang from amid the vociferating mob, hurled
himself upon the Prince, and thrusting a great, broad-bladed Circassian
<em>khanga</em> into his bosom, was away and out of sight almost
before any of the bystanders had recovered from this second shock
of horror and surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>His Highness, who had sunk to the ground under the blow,
though he did not lose consciousness, was at once carried into the
Mission-house, distant a few yards only, and very speedily all the
best medical advice obtainable in Samakoff was at hand, while
telegrams for further assistance were at once despatched to Sofia
and to Philippopolis, the latter place being perhaps more rapidly
accessible than the capital. The first examination of the wound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>showed that the broad knife had turned on the point of a rib—very
fortunately—and had therefore missed, by a hair’s-breadth
the envelope of the heart. It was not till to-day that a persistent
recurrence of internal hæmorrhage aroused the gravest fears of the
Prince’s surgeons, and prompted them to appeal to Constantinople
for further advice.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF PRINCE FERDINAND OF BULGARIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The pretended priest, when searched, was found to be costumed
beneath his robes in the ordinary dress of the petty trader of the
towns here. His long flowing locks proved a wig, and his thick
unkempt beard was also false. Upon him, among other papers
said to be of great importance, but as to which I know nothing,
was found a passport issued by the Russian Consulate at Odessa
no less recently than last month, and bearing the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">visé</span></i> of the
Russian Chancellor at Sofia. The passport is made out in the
name of Ivan Bendukdjieff, and belongs, the fellow avows, to a
man, a stranger to him, who left it with him by mistake a week
ago. But the authorities entertain few doubts as to the scoundrel’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>identity with one of the men implicated with Shishmanoff in the
recent murder of Dr. Vulkovitch.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have said that the news of this dastardly attempt on Prince
Ferdinand’s life caused the greatest excitement in Constantinople.
There is indeed no doubt that both the Palace and the Porte are
very seriously alarmed, as, in view of the Sultan’s disgraceful action
in the Vulkovitch affair, it is only just they should be. It is
significant of his Majesty’s state of mind that, when early this
(Sunday) morning, first the French and then the Russian Ambassador
drove to the residence of the Grand Vizier, they were unable
to see him, orders having been sent from Yildiz ordering the
Pasha not to receive them. Sir Clare Ford, on the other hand, had
a long interview with the Sultan this morning.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When the train steamed into the station here, I learned in the
restaurant, where every one was eagerly discussing the events of the
past two days, that the second assassin was captured yesterday
afternoon at Banja, as the result of an order widely circulated by
both telegraph and horse messengers throughout the country,
calling upon all Tchorbadjis, or headmen of villages, to detain any
stranger found within their jurisdiction, and at once communicate
with the nearest central authority. The man has been identified
as one Nicholi Nāoum, a very well-known character who, besides
being suspected of participation in the murder, last spring, of M.
Beltcheff, is known to have been acting for the past six months as
a revolutionary agent on the Macedonian frontier. Nāoum, who,
as leader of a gang of border brigands, has gained a bloody
notoriety in connection with various dastardly outrages against
society, is believed to have been recently engaged in distributing
arms and ammunition among Macedonian villages, and in inciting
the Macedonians to molest the Bulgarians dwelling among them.
Nāoum, when arrested, was found to be provided, like his accomplice,
with a Russian passport executed in regular form. He was immediately
carried back to Samakoff and confronted with Bendukdjieff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>against whom he at once began to rail as a bungler, making no
attempt to exonerate himself, or to deny his share in the tragedy.
In this course, perhaps, he was guided by the knowledge that his
life was already forfeited for many atrocious crimes before he set
his hand against Prince Ferdinand. As a consequence of his last
admission of guilt, a very brief trial was necessary, and the two
wretches were hanged this morning outside the house in which
they had lodged on Friday night in Samakoff.</p>

<p>M. STAMBULOFF<br /><br />Prime Minister of Bulgaria, appointed Regent after the attempted assassination of Prince Ferdinand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Prince is apparently doing well. M. Stambuloff, who,
on receipt of news of the disaster, hurried to his master’s bedside,
remained but one hour in Samakoff, during which time, despite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the doctors, the Prince insisted on seeing him, and returned direct
to Sofia. Late on Saturday night, at a meeting attended by most
of the Ministers, hurriedly convened, he was declared Regent
during the serious illness of the Prince, and for such time as might
be necessary, and the formal proclamation in accordance with this
decision was issued yesterday morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of accompanying Dr. Patterson and his colleagues on a,
to me, fruitless expedition to Samakoff, I bid them good-bye at
Ichtiman, where they left the train, and came on here. As might
be expected, I have found this city boiling with tumultuous
emotions, and not only—though that were sufficient cause—on
account of the outrageous attempt on Prince Ferdinand’s life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears that the Cabinet has received news of the greatest
importance from the Macedonian frontier. The assiduous efforts
of Russian agents, who have been actively engaged for the past six
months or more not only in the provinces itself, but also in the
Greek and Montenegrin borders, in fomenting an anti-Bulgarian
rising, are now on the eve of being crowned with success. Already
reports have reached the capital of disturbances, caused apparently
by raids made across the border at Petrovich and Melnik. That
there is a great shifting of troops at present in progress as a result
of this intelligence, is not denied. It is said, indeed, though I
cannot as yet tell with what truth, that a half division has been
ordered to Petrovich, and another like force to Strumnitza. The
latest rumour here is to the effect that the movement in Macedonia
is as much anti-Turkish as anti-Bulgarian, and that Turkey is also
despatching a large military force to Salonika. If this report be
true, it is surely an instance of the irony of fate. In this country
it is a matter of common talk that any anti-Bulgarian movement
in Macedonia is mainly due to the attitude of Zuknir Pasha, the
Vali of Salonika, towards the large Bulgarian element of the population
of the province under his control. This functionary’s
persistent ill-treatment of Bulgarians has been very frequently represented
to the Porte in notes from this capital as being contrary at
once to the interests of Turkey and of Bulgaria. The Principality, it
has been said, has consistently refused to take side with those who
seek the dismemberment of Turkey, and has claimed a right to expect
that the development of the Bulgarian element in Macedonia would
not be crushed by Pashas who, by their arbitrary actions, paralyse
the intentions of the central government, and prepare the way for
events which had better, in the common interest, be avoided. It
is needless to say these sensible warnings have been altogether
disregarded by the Porte, with the present inevitable result.</p>

<p>THE BULGARIAN MOBILISATION—TROOPS MARCHING THROUGH THE STREETS OF PHILIPPOPOLIS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>It is further rumoured here—for the place is full of suspicion—that
in view of certain movements of Servian troops, a large
Bulgarian force has been hurriedly thrown forward to strengthen
the troops at Radomir, Trn, and Zaribrod.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The latest reports as to Prince Ferdinand are more favourable
than could have been hoped for. The dangerous symptoms have
subsided. Internal hæmorrhage has been checked. The Prince
sleeps and takes nourishment, and his pulse and temperature are
satisfactory. Hopes are held out that in a week’s time His
Highness may be moved from Samakoff. Meanwhile, during the
past few days, events have marched so rapidly that people here are
prepared for almost any eventuality. There is no longer any
attempt to conceal the movements of Servian troops. Great
numbers of men are already massed at Nisch and Vranja, and at
points on the line of railway between Nisch and Pirot. The main
body of the Servian army has its headquarters at Knuzevatz.
From Belgrade, we learn of the steady despatch of war material
and siege-train to Negotin on the frontier against Widdin, and a
telegram from the same source announces the arrival at Nisch of a
train of the Red Cross Society, consisting of eighteen carriages
furnished with all the necessary equipment for active service.</p>

<p class='c011'>News from Constantinople is to the effect that the Porte,
alarmed at the aspect of affairs in Macedonia, has, in addition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the calling out of the last class of rediffs, decided on the formation
of five new Army Corps. Fresh levies are to be made in order to
form a strong reserve. The transport of rediffs, mainly from Smyrna,
Skanderoun, and the Tripolitaine, is being carried on on a large
scale. Over 27,000 reservists have already passed through Smyrna.
Many of the Austrian Lloyd vessels being engaged in the transport
of troops to Salonika to guard the frontier line and to
reinforce the Bitolia garrison, the Seraskierate is negotiating with
some English shipping companies for additional transport. More
than fifty thousand troops are to be employed on the Macedonian
border in a line stretching from Mitrovitza on the north, all
round to Raslok on the south-east. Their chief stations will be
Palanka, with Uskub as base, and Djuma and Neurokoy with
Strumdja as base. No further disturbances are reported from the
frontier.</p>

<p>THE SERVO-BULGARIAN CAMPAIGN—THROUGH PIROT TO THE FRONT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>M. Stambuloff left here last night to inspect the troops on
the frontier. I am, of course, unable to give any information as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to their numbers or disposition, but it may be said that Bulgaria
is well prepared to resist any attack. It is infringing no rule to
say that the Prince’s army possesses no fewer than 400 pieces of
ordnance of all calibres. The report that his appointment as
Regent has met with disapprobation among a large section of the
community here is absolutely without foundation.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trusted agent of the Government has also left here for
Berlin, for the purpose, it is understood, of raising a loan in that
capital.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>We are now at war, and fighting is going forward even as I
write. This morning rifle-shots were exchanged between Servian
and Bulgarian patrolling parties on the frontier, near Trn, without
result on either side. A body of some 300 Servians then crossed
the frontier and advanced about a mile, seeking to cut off a party
of fifty Bulgarians, who, however, retreated and escaped. Later
on heavy fighting was reported in the neighbourhood of Vlassina.
How it originated is immaterial. The Bulgarians lost 17 men
killed and 54 wounded. This set fire to the torch all along the
frontier line. Some time before the official declaration of war,
which, though it announced that hostilities would begin at noon
to-day, did not reach the Minister for Foreign Affairs here until
nine o’clock this evening, reports had been posted up in the cafés
announcing fighting in the vicinity of Planinitza, Beuskedol,
Miloslawtzi, Zelene, and Gard, in the Trn district. The Servian
Minister, who had twice telegraphed to his Government for
instructions during the afternoon, demanded a special train as
soon as he had presented the declaration of war, and left half an
hour later, under escort, for the frontier.</p>

<p class='c011'>A solemn <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span></cite> was sung this evening in the Cathedral,
M. Stambuloff and the Ministers being present. The streets are
crowded—no one shows any intention of going to bed; the popular
enthusiasm and confidence are immense, and there is apparently a
general sensation of relief at the relaxation of the strain of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>past few days, and a feeling of satisfaction that the dastardly
attack on the Prince will be promptly avenged. I am, by the
way, authorised to state that, by order of Prince Ferdinand’s
physicians, all news of these exciting events is rigidly withheld
from his Highness.</p>

<p>AN AFFAIR OF OUTPOSTS—THE FIRST SHOT IN THE SERVO-BULGARIAN CAMPAIGN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At the moment of closing this despatch, news comes of an
important action near Dragoman, with reported defeat of the
Servians with heavy losses.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Sofia</span>, <em>April 11</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is to be no more fighting. The brilliant and most
sanguinary engagement at Dragoman, which I reported in progress
last night, in the course of which the Bulgarians, who were completely
successful, drove the enemy back from all their positions
on the heights above the pass: an incessant artillery duel, maintained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>ever since the commencement of hostilities between the
heavy Servian batteries before Negotin and the Bulgarian forces
garrisoning Widelin, and a very successful unopposed advance
along the Vranja road as far as the Morava river by a Bulgarian
force, composed of three brigades from Sofia, from Trn, and from
Radomir, make up all there is to report of the campaign. For
when hostilities were about to be opened this morning near
Kumareno, which was evidently held by a large Servian force, an
officer bearing a white towel, with a pink fringe, tied to a hedge
stake, as a flag of truce, rode out from the Servian lines and
demanded a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourparler</span></i>. It then transpired that the Servians
found themselves in a terrible quandary, and were at their wits’
end what to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late last night a large Austrian force had, without warning,
crossed the Save into Belgrade, which city they had taken so completely
by surprise that it was not until the morning that the
populace was made aware of the presence of the strangers in their
midst by the sight of the troops bivouacking in the squares, and
the officers quietly breakfasting outside the principal cafés. An
Austrian force, said the parlementaire, had also crossed the Danube
to Semendria, and there were rumours that another force had
crossed the same river at Orsova. In these circumstances, with
their capital cut off from them, and their young king and government
in a manner locked up, the Servian generals considered they
had no alternative but to demand a suspension of hostilities, at
least for forty-eight hours. An armistice was therefore granted,
much to the Bulgarian leaders’ annoyance and disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>We learn that Austria has notified the Powers that she has
occupied Semendria and Belgrade as a precautionary measure, in
view of the wanton aggression of Servia.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is here considered unlikely that Bulgaria will have any
more trouble from this quarter. On the other hand, however,
grave rumours reach us from Constantinople, where apparently
there is very great anxiety as to certain mysterious and as yet
undefined threats by Russia. The Turkish capital is, as matters
stand at present, likely to be the chief centre of interest for some
time to come, and I shall therefore return there to-morrow morning.</p>

agitating Porte and Palace. By his foolishly near-sighted policy
of pandering to the wishes of whatsoever Power bullies him with
most brutal persistency, at the risk though it be of injuring a
friendly State, the Sultan has, as he is beginning to realise, succeeded
in alienating, for the moment at least, the sympathies of
all his legitimate friends. By his attitude—wilfully perverse and
undignified—throughout the varying phases of the Vulkovitch
episode, his Majesty has aroused throughout Bulgaria deep distrust
of himself, and fierce indignation against his ministers and his
methods. The inane and futile strivings of the Porte to throw
difficulties in the path of the young Khedive, and to cheat him, if
possible, of rights clearly accorded and amply paid for, have produced
similar sentiments in Egypt and in England. And having,
at the cost of much labour and intrigue, achieved this wholly
unsatisfactory position of being an object of contempt, suspicion,
and obloquy, the Sultan finds himself suddenly but decidedly
thrown over by the very Powers with whom he had sought to
curry favour. The Russian Ambassador is now too thoroughly
pre-occupied with the immediate policy of his own Government to
have any further care to wear gloves in his dealings with the
Porte, and his mood has so affected M. Cambon, the French
Ambassador, that that astute personage, unable to find those sweet
professions and gracious persuasion—half unmeaning promise,
half veiled threat with which he has been wont to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dorloter</span></i> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Ministers at Bab Aali—come readily to his tongue, has ceased for
a fortnight past to hold any other than mere <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chancellerie</span> communication
with the Turkish Government.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let it be said at once that, despite very natural indignation,
Bulgaria shows every disposition to behave well towards the
Suzerain Power. Officially, indeed, her attitude has been in every
way admirable. When the Servians opened hostilities, when they
declared war, when they asked for an armistice—in every phase,
in short, of the quarrel, M. Stambuloff apprised, and asked
counsel and aid of, the Sultan. To be sure he got nothing for his
pains, but it must have been a satisfaction to the Sultan to receive
proof that, in one quarter at any rate, he is not regarded as a
European Power of merely sentimental importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fresh alarm was caused here this morning by the discovery
that our telegraphic communication has been interrupted at once
with Odessa and with Batoum. All inquiries as to the cause of
the rupture made by other routes failed to elicit any explanation.
Later in the day a vessel of the Cunard line arrived in the Bosphorus,
and her captain has stated that the Russian harbour-master
at Odessa is detaining all ships, of whatever nationality, in
that port. His own vessel, he says, was the last to leave Odessa,
and only got away by a chance, the order having reached him
when he had already got under way. He states that there were
several Russian ironclads, and quite a fleet of torpedo boats at
Odessa, all with steam up, and says that when he was on shore
there the day before yesterday the town was full of soldiers, and
the approaches to the dockyards crowded with a constantly-increasing
mass of guns, horses, ammunition, and other war material.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have received a telegram from my correspondent in Sofia,
who tells me that the Bulgarian Government understands that the
Russians are preparing an expedition for sea at Odessa, and intend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to occupy some portion of Bulgarian territory. The Princely Government
has reason to expect the attack will be directed against Varna,
and has called upon the Sultan to aid Bulgarian arms by sending
his fleet to guard the Varna roads. The Sultan has as yet made
no reply to this request, says my correspondent, but it is not
difficult to guess what His Majesty’s action will be, inasmuch as
Turkey has no single ship of war in condition to be got to sea
under a month at the least, and it is more than questionable whether
even then any of the ironclads could be completely manned or
provided with serviceable ammunition. There are, indeed, some
torpedo boats—unprovided, I understand, with torpedoes—and a
couple of the monitors that did some service in the Danube in
the last war. If the Admiralty should elect to place these vessels
at the service of the Bulgarian Government, they might be of some
use as scouts. But that is about all that Turkey can hope to do
for her vassal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here there is terrible anxiety lest the Russian expedition be
directed, not against Varna or Bourgas, but against the Kavaks,
and the Seraskierate is busily taking precautions to meet such a
contingency with all the forces available.</p>

<p class='c011'>Despite the recent draining of the Stamboul camp by the
despatch of a large force to Salonika, there are still some 45,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>men in and around the capital. These, with the exception of the
Sultan’s guard of about 15,000 men, have been distributed along
the chain of forts extending from Roumelie Kavak to the Golden
Horn. The telegraph is kept busily at work summoning troops
from all parts of the Empire. 15,000 men from the Adrianople
garrison are expected to arrive here to-night.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Russian Ambassador is said to be ill. He has not left the
Embassy in the Grand Rue de Pera for now almost a week, and
refuses to receive any one. Even his French colleague found the

a peaceful occupation of Bourgas and Varna with that end in view.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Never since the fateful days of July 1870 has so much excitement
been caused here as by the news—which now seems to be
beyond all doubt—that Russia, having received an evasive, or, as
other telegrams put it, a flatly negative reply to her peremptory
demand for the immediate evacuation of Belgrade by the Austrians,
has already begun to move down immense masses of troops towards
her south-western frontier; and it is even rumoured that a
division of cavalry has suddenly made its appearance near the
border, on the Warsaw-Cracow road, at a place called Xiaswielki.
This is a grave situation, indeed, as alarming as it is sudden. The
Unter den Linden, which is a perfect Babel with the bawling voices
of the newsvendors, is rapidly filling with crowds rushing hither,
as to the main channel of intelligence, from all parts of the
city, and the Foreign Office in the Wilhelm-Strasse is besieged by
a huge throng clamouring to hear the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>For on this depends the issue of peace or war for Germany.
Let but Russia lay one single finger of aggression on Austria,
and Germany must at once unsheath her sword and spring to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>her ally’s aid. Pray let there be no mistake as to the terms of the
Austro-German Treaty of 1879, which was published a year or two
ago, for it has often been misinterpreted. Under this instrument
a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus fœderis</span></i> does not arise for Germany in all and any circumstances
of a war between Russia and Austria, but only in the event
of the former being the aggressor; and it looks very much as
though Russia were now seriously bent on taking the offensive.
Does she really mean to do this? is the question on every one’s
lips here, and the excitement of people is equal to their suspense.
It is known that an active correspondence by wire is proceeding
between here and Vienna, but the authorities are very reticent,
and only beg the crowds to keep calm and hope for the best.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have just returned from the Schloss, whither the multitude,
which was unable to gratify its curiosity at the Foreign Office, had
surged along to pursue its eager inquiries, but only to find that
the Emperor was closeted with his Chancellor, General Count
von Caprivi, and his Chief of the Staff, Count von Schlieffen. It
was remarked that when both these magnates emerged from their
interview with His Majesty, and drove off at a rapid rate, they
looked very serious and pre-occupied, paying but little heed to the
cheering which greeted their appearance. This only tended to
deepen the apprehension of the vast crowd in front of the Schloss,
whose fears were further augmented by a rumour (a true one, as I
found on tracing it to its source), which spread like lightning, that
the Emperor had telegraphed for the King of Saxony, Prince
Albrecht of Prussia, Prince-Regent of Brunswick—both Field-Marshals—as
also for Count Waldersee, Commander of the Ninth
Army Corps in Schleswig-Holstein, whom the Emperor, it may be
remembered, when parting with this distinguished officer, as Chief
of the General Staff, publicly designated as the Commander of a
whole army in the event of war.</p>

<p class='c011'>After despatching my last message, which I had the utmost
difficulty in doing owing to the frantic mass of newspaper correspondents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of all nationalities struggling desperately into and out
of the Telegraph Office, I had the good fortune to meet Baron von
Marschall, the amiable and accomplished Foreign Secretary, who
favoured me with a brief conversation on the momentous subject
of the hour. Yes, he said, it was unfortunately quite true that the
Russians were rapidly concentrating their forces towards the Austro-German
frontier, and that a sotnia of prying Cossacks, coming from
Tarnogrod, had even pushed forward on the Austrian side of the
border towards Jaroslav, an important railway junction point in
Galicia. He had just received intelligence to this effect from
Prince Reuss, the German Ambassador in Vienna, who added that
things indeed looked their very worst. ‘But this,’ I remarked, ‘is
an act of invasion on the part of Russia, is it not, and means
war?’ The Baron shook his head ominously, and, with a kindly
‘come and see me again to-morrow morning,’ squeezed my hand
and hurried off to see Count Syéchényi at the Austrian Embassy,
which stands over against the former home of M. Benedetti,
with all its associations connected with the beginning of Germany’s
last great war.</p>

<p class='c011'>On my way back to the Telegraph Office, where I write
this, I encountered, just at the entrance to the Russian Embassy,
Unter den Linden, its genial and honest occupant, Count
Schouvaloff, who was good enough to return my greeting by
motioning me to stop, and telling me that he had just been to see
Count Caprivi, and assure him, on the part of his Imperial master,
that all these warlike preparations in Western Poland implied no
menace whatever to Germany, with whom Russia had not the
least cause of quarrel, but that, nevertheless, so long as Austria
threatened to derange the balance of power in the Balkan Peninsula
for her own selfish ends, Russia would be incriminating herself
in the eyes of history if she stood by with folded hands
and sought not to safeguard her most vital interests by all the
means at her disposal. And as Pitt had created a new world to
redress the balance of the old, so Russia was now compelled to
re-establish equilibrium in one part of the Eastern Continent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Europe by giving the would-be disturber of this equilibrium
work enough to engross all his attention in another. ‘These were
not, of course, the very words,’ added the Count, ‘which I used to
the Chancellor, but they express the exact sense of my communication.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Berlin, which has poured all its teeming million-and-a-half
into the streets, is at this hour a scene of the wildest excitement,
owing to a rumour (and a friend of mine in the General Staff,
whom I chanced to meet, confirmed the truth of the rumour), that
the awful and electrifying words ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Krieg, mobil!</span></i>’ had (as in 1870)
been already flashed again to no fewer than seven of the twenty
Army Corps constituting the Imperial host—viz., to the 1st, or
East Prussian; the 17th, West Prussian; the 3d, Brandenburg;
the 4th, Province of Prussian Saxony; the 5th, Posen; the 6th,
Silesian; and the 12th, Kingdom of Saxony.</p>

<p class='c011'>Loud and long was the cheering in front of the Schloss—which
is thronged by an ever-increasing and excited multitude—when
this intelligence oozed out, and with one accord (for your Germans
are a most wonderful people of trained choral-singers) the whole
mighty assemblage burst forth with a battle-ballad, in which some
deft patriotic poet had been quick to embody the fears and determinations
of the last few days under the title of ‘<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Weichsel-Wacht</span></cite>,’
or the ‘Watch on the Vistula’—a war-song which promises to
fill as large and luminous a page among the lyric gems of the
Fatherland as Schneckenburger’s immortal ‘<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wacht am Rhein</span></cite>.’
When the frantic cheering which followed the chanting of this
stirring battle-anthem had subsided, the Emperor (who has now
completely recovered from the accident to his knee) came out to
bow his acknowledgments from the front balcony of the castle;
and on his arm was the Empress holding the hand of the pretty
little flaxen-haired Crown Prince, who had been routed out of his
warm bed at this late and chilly hour to add one crowning touch
of spectacular effect to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableau</span></i> which, amid another frenzied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>outburst of ‘hochs’ and ‘hurrahs,’ thus closed the drama of a most
exciting and momentous day.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The excitement of the last few days has now calmed down into
the serious and stolid determination, which is the most striking
characteristic of the German race, and though it is known that,
since the order to mobilise seven Army Corps was issued,
M. Herbette, the French Ambassador, has had repeated interviews
with General Caprivi, the nation is meanwhile content to suppress
its suspicion with regard to the possible—nay, probable—policy of
its western neighbour, and devote all its attention to the development
of events on its eastern border.</p>

<p class='c011'>Certain official telegrams which I have been allowed to peruse
leave little doubt that, while the Russians are making a show of
massing troops in the direction of Cracow, the real line of their
strategic advance is towards the Lemberg side, whence a railway
leads across the Carpathians to Buda-Pesth. It is argued here
that, had the Russians merely to deal with Austria alone, the
likeliest line of their advance would be by way of Cracow and its
fortress, which they would endeavour to turn, and then strike for
Vienna by the route which has been deemed, on the whole, the
easier for them, namely, that which leads to the valley of the
Danube across Austrian Silesia, and through the gap between the
Bohemian and Carpathian mountains. But with a German army
massed in Silesia, and menacing their right flank, the advantages
of this route would be more than countervailed, and so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Russians seem to have chosen an invading route as remote as
possible from the German base of attack, namely, <em>viâ</em> Lemberg and
Stryj.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the mobilisation of the seven German Army Corps,
enumerated by me in a previous despatch, is in full swing, the
reserve men hastening to the colours with great alacrity; and as
the railways are working night and day, all public traffic being
suspended, the troops will soon be in the various positions assigned
them. The 12th, or Royal Saxon Corps, it seems, is to be sent
over to strengthen the Austrians, which will appear a wise and
tactful disposition, when it is remembered how the Saxons fought
shoulder to shoulder with the Austrians at Königgrätz; while
Field-Marshal Prince George (brother of the King of Saxony) has
been intrusted by the Emperor with the command of what is to
be called the Army of Silesia, consisting of the 5th and 6th Corps,
now swiftly concentrating between Breslau (which, being at present
an open town, is undergoing rapid circumvallation by a ring of
earthwork forts armed with Schumann gun-turrets) and Neisse,
the Prussian Crown Prince’s point of departure for Bohemia in
1866. On the other hand, a Second Army, consisting of the 3d and
4th Corps, to be called ‘of the Vistula,’ and to be commanded by
the King of Saxony, is swiftly massing round Thorn, that Metz of
the East; while a Third Army, compounded of the 1st and 17th
Corps (East and West Prussia), and denominated ‘of the Baltic,’
has been assigned to Count Waldersee, and is fast taking
position on the line flanked by the fortresses of Königsberg and
Lötzen, the task assigned to it being evidently an invasion of the
Baltic Provinces and the consequent splitting up and diversion of
the Russian forces from their southern objective. As to the First
and Second German Armies (those of Silesia and the Vistula), a
glance at the map will show that, roughly speaking, they form the
base ends of a triangle whereof Warsaw is the apex, and that a well-timed
advance by road or rail, for both are available, would enable
them to effect a junction (on Moltke’s principle of marching
separately and fighting combined, as applied with such brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>success at Sadowa), and give decisive battle to the Russians somewhere
near Warsaw.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I may not indulge at present in a more detailed forecast of
the impending campaign and its incidents. Suffice to say that the
Germans promise to keep General Gourko, commanding the
Russian forces in Poland, quite as busy as General Dragomiroff,
commander at Kieff, and chief director of the operations against
Galicia, will be kept by the Austrians themselves on their
particular side of the seat of war.</p>

afternoon at the Central Station, which is littered about with beer
barrels and piles of edibles offered by the citizens for the refreshment
and encouragement of the ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">tapfere Krieger</span></i>’ who are going at
last to measure their strength with the Muscovites, when the
Bismarck Cuirassiers from Halberstadt steamed slowly up to the

powerful engines water. Rolls and sausages were showered into the
carriages containing these splendid heavy troopers (in whose ranks,

laird—now Rittmeister, like Dugald Dalgetty, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aide-de-camp</span></i> to

away there arose another ringing cheer mingled with ‘Hochs’ for
Bismarck (and I wonder how the exile of Friedrichsruh feels at the
contemplation of all this!)—cheers and ‘hochs’ that were responded
to by these big, deep-chested fellows roaring out the ‘Watch on

nation, and kindled its heart into a fine warlike glow.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-night the Emperor gave a grand military banquet in the
White Saloon of the Schloss previous to his starting for Thorn—that
tremendous bulwark on the Vistula over against the Russian
frontier, where the work of concentrating the German troops is
proceeding rapidly. At this banquet I was favoured with a seat
in the gallery, from which I have witnessed so many pomps and
pageants at this Court; and when the third course had been
reached, His Majesty (who wore the gala uniform of the Gardes du
Corps) rose, and, amid a silence in which you might have even
heard the fall of a hair, addressed his guests as follows, in a most
resolute and rasping voice:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine Herren</span></i>, God has willed it that Germany should draw
her sword in defence of her ally, and to God’s high, holy will we
all must bow. German loyalty (‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Treue</span></i>’) has ever been
one of the most conspicuous virtues of our race, and, if we now
failed to prove true to our treaty engagements, we should justly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>deserve to become a mockery and a bye-word among the nations.
Remembering, as I do, the very last words almost which were
addressed to me by my beloved grandfather, now resting in God,
who conjured me to be considerate towards and cultivate the
friendship of Russia, it is with a heart full of exceeding heaviness
that I look forward to the events that are ahead of us. Nevertheless,
it shall be in the power of no one to say that the German
Government was ever wanting in fidelity, or the German army
deficient in courage.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gentlemen, that courage has been displayed on a thousand
glorious battle-fields, and never more so than in those stupendous
and heroic encounters which made of us a great and united nation—a
nation whereof the safety and integrity would be gravely
imperilled by disaster, involving, perhaps, disruption to the dual
monarchy of our allies. Such a result, gentlemen, we cannot
endure; and it is to obviate the bare possibility of such a thing
that we are now about to respond to the solemn call of treaty
obligations, by placing some of our heroic troops side by side with
the brave army of my august friend and ally, His Majesty the
Emperor Francis-Joseph; nor is it to be doubted that this companionship-in-arms,
among other things, will have the blessed
effect of wiping out all memory of our past conflicts and estrangements,
and of re-uniting, in the bonds of fraternal love and loyalty,
the two greatest sections of the mighty and invincible German
race.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine Herren</span></i>, God is above us, but uncertainty, to some
extent, is before us. Within the last few years the science of war
has been completely revolutionised, and we are all now about to
grapple with military problems which never taxed the powers of
our predecessors. As the Supreme War-Lord (‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">oberste Kriegs-Herr</span></i>’)
of our armies, I mean to make inspection of such of our
forces as are now marshalling themselves on our Eastern marches
and also to remain at their head unless—which God forfend!—the
course of events should call me elsewhere. (Sensation.)</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But, gentlemen, I do not require to tell you that the duties and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>functions of a commander are very different now from what they
were at the beginning of this century, not to speak of the time of
my invincible and immortal ancestor, Frederick the Great, who
inspired his troops by his very presence and directed them <em>in</em>
battle; whereas now all that is nearly left to the modern commander-in-chief
is to lead his forces up <em>to</em> battle and then leave
them to the charge of his subordinates—an era in the science of
warfare which was inaugurated by that great scientific soldier,
lately, alas! taken from us, who has written his deathless name in
indelible letters of gold on the tablets of his country’s history.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Forbidden by the nature and necessities of warfare, as now
practised, to be a tactician—such as Cæsar, or Frederick, or Napoleon,
or Wellington—the modern commander-in-chief must restrict himself
to the task of strategy, and intrust his colonels and his captains
with the duty of beating the enemy in detail. And as a modern
battle must necessarily stretch over a vast extent of front, it really
resolves itself into a hundred separate combats, in which even
company leaders become independent commanders; and thus,
gentlemen, to all of you there is opened up a glorious prospect
of doing your duty to your country and achieving a distinction
which was reserved to the generalissimos of yore. But though
thus every colonel and every captain among you is now a commander-in-chief,
it behoves you to remember that, what with
smokeless powder, magazine rifles of vast range, and other innovations,
the conditions of fighting have altered immensely even
since Germany last took the field; but I doubt not that you will
all prove true to our highest traditions, and that our brave army,
with God’s blessing, will once more show the stuff of which it is
made.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gentlemen, this is a solemn moment, and it is not in a spirit
of festive mirth, but rather under the influence of the serious feelings
which dominate us all, that I ask you to drain your glasses
to the health of my august ally, His Majesty Francis-Joseph,
Emperor of Austria-Hungary. Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!’</p>

<p class='c011'>To-morrow the Emperor will leave for the frontier, and I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>been graciously permitted by His Majesty to attach myself to his

<p class='c011'>It is long since the Linden Avenue witnessed such a scene of
crowding and excitement as it presented to-day, when the Emperor
(who wore the drill uniform of his Silesian Bodyguard
Cuirassiers, named of the Great Elector), drove from the Schloss
to the Central Station to take train for Thorn. His Majesty
was accompanied by the Empress, who looked very sad, where her
august husband only wore a serious mien. The fine sunny
weather, balmy already with the fragrance of the budding spring,
had lured thousands and thousands into the streets to see the
away-going of the Emperor on his first campaign; and it was
only with great difficulty that the demi-squadron of cavalry
(Gardes du Corps) escorting the Imperial victoria could advance
through the packed and cheering masses of people who thronged
every inch of standing-space in Unter den Linden, and reached
up to the very house-tops.</p>

<p class='c011'>At one point of its route, just opposite Café Bauer, the
Emperor’s carriage was even brought to a stop; and it was then
that a very excited gentleman (who turned out to be an American
admirer of His Majesty) profited by the opportunity to throw a
laurel wreath into the Imperial equipage. Quick as thought, the
Emperor placed the wreath on the point of his sword-scabbard
and tossed it back to his adulator, saying with a smile, ‘Wait a
little, my friend; let us earn this first’—a sally that was the
signal for a perfect storm of cheers on the part of the witnesses
of this charming incident, which furnished them with additional
reason for lauding the Emperor’s modesty and good sense.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was much cheering, hat-waving and fluttering of handkerchiefs
as their Imperial Majesties—who never ceased bowing
their acknowledgments—threaded their way to the station, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>platform of which was assembled Headquarter-Staff, with the great
Household officers and Ministers of State (who looked very grave
indeed), and others whom duty or curiosity had brought to see
the Emperor off. After conversing for a few minutes with Count
Caprivi (who, unlike his predecessor in office, is not to go to the
front in the meantime, pending the development of French
schemes), His Majesty turned to his sad-eyed consort, whom he
embraced with great warmth, and then entered his travelling
saloon carriage. In another moment, amid three parting ‘hochs,’
the train had glided away, carrying with it the first German
Emperor who has unsheathed his sword against the Czar of all
the Russias.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Following the route taken by the Emperor, I arrived here this
morning, thanks to the courtesy of Baron von Tauchnitz (a son of
the great Leipzig publisher of the well-known Continental edition
of our English classics), who kindly allowed me a place (it was
only a standing one) in the train conveying to the front the
Magdeburg Artillery Regiment of his command, as well as the
Train, or Army Service, Battalion of the 4th Corps.</p>

<p class='c011'>While crossing the bridge from the railway station to claim the
quarters that had been assigned me at the ‘Black Bear,’ my eye and
ear were suddenly struck by a strange hubbub going on below. A
troop of red-tunic’d Zieten Hussars (‘Duke of Connaught’s’) were
watering their horses in the Vistula, which has here a broad, placid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and majestic course; and while these thirsty animals were revelling
in delicious draughts of the first water they had tasted since leaving
Rathenow (their garrison townlet, near Bismarck’s native place),
their riders were amusing themselves by roaring and laughing at
the frantic efforts of what seemed to me to be a big Newfoundland
dog to extricate himself from the stream. Presently the poor
brute, which to my great astonishment gradually assumed human
shape, struggled, spluttering and gasping, on to the shelving bank;
and then it was that I recognised in this buffeted and bedraggled
creature, Solomon Hirsch, the well-known correspondent of the
<cite>Berliner Tageblatt</cite>, whose shock head of hair, all touzled and
dishevelled, had given him the semblance of canine form and
feature alluded to. It appears that poor Hirsch, fulfilling his
functions with more zeal than discretion, had already made himself
an object of universal execration at the front by communicating
to his paper most minute details as to the massing and
position of the German troops towards the Russian frontier, and
that being recognised by these rollicking and resentful Zieten
Hussar fellows, to whom he had, in an evil moment for himself,
appealed for information as to their ultimate destination, this
‘curse of modern armies’ was at once set upon, hilariously tossed
in a horse-rug, and then contemptuously heaved into the Vistula.
I have made a point of dwelling on this serio-comic incident, which
I myself was quick to take to heart, as it will serve to explain the
absence from my telegrams of all but the most meagre and general
references to the positions and movements of the German troops;
and, indeed, I should be worthy the fate of my hapless colleague
did I abuse the hospitality which has been so graciously extended
to me by revealing unexecuted plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Indeed, I have only been promised the use of the field and
other telegraph wires on the strict condition that my messages
never exceed a limited number of words, which will necessarily
restrict my reports to the briefest and barest, yet, I trust, sufficient
summaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Emperor (who was accompanied by the King of Saxony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and other high general officers) has just returned from a rapid ride
round the circle of the outer forts, within which the troops are all
lying under canvas; and from the top of the Garrison Church
Steeple, the highest point in this mighty fortressed town, nothing
can be seen but endless vistas of tented bivouacs. Never before
has the German soldier been allowed any other night covering in
the field but the canopy of heaven, though, indeed, in a country
like France, which is, in truth, a land flowing with milk, wine, and
honey, and teeming with villages and other opportunities of
cantonment, he had comparatively little need of tents. But it is
quite a different thing in Russia, with its raw and rigid climate, its
vast, uncultivated, and uninhabited spaces; and it was in view of
the probable contingency of a campaign in such a foodless and
roofless wilderness that the General Staff, with that remarkable
foresight and wisdom which has always distinguished it, resolved
to equip all the Army Corps lying nearest the Eastern frontier
with the very best tents procurable—namely, such as were at once
waterproof, windproof, and even fireproof. For otherwise what
ruin might not a spark from a bivouac fire entail upon the tented
fields which stretch away in every direction towards the horizon,
both here and at Posen, at Neisse, and at Königsberg, reminding
one of the hosts, countless as the sands on the sea-shore, of the five
kings who encamped over against Gibeon.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I must not omit to record a curious incident which
happened as the Emperor was riding past the statue of Copernicus,
whose birthplace was Thorn. Just when abreast the monument
of that immortal astronomer, His Majesty remarked to his suite:
‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja, meine Herren</span></i>, there you see the man who first opened the eyes
of the world to the true nature of the solar system; and I think
that with God’s help we shall equally be able to assign Russia her
proper place in the system of nations.’</p>

<p class='c011'>To-night the Emperor (who continues to display wonderfully
good spirits and energy) gave a banquet in the hastily furbished-up
rooms of the gloomy old Schloss, in honour of Feldzeugmeister
Baron Beck, the Chief of the Austrian Staff, who, pending the
progress of his well-thought-out mobilisation and massing scheme,
which he had set a-going by a simple order from Vienna, had
hastily run up here by rail to concert united action with his
German colleague, Count von Schlieffen, the present occupier of
Moltke’s high and responsible office. From a trustworthy source
I gather that this was the substance of Baron von Beck’s communication:—</p>

<p class='c011'>It had been discovered, beyond all doubt, that the main
objective of the Russian invasion was Lemberg, in the direction of
which Dragomiroff was concentrating immense masses of troops,
drawn from the 4th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th Army Corps, in the
rear of whom other forces, furnished by the remoter 13th, 16th,
17th and other Corps, were pushing up as fast as the defective
railway system of the country would allow them. Austria, on her
part, had resolved to combine her defensive forces into three
armies—one of about 300,000 strong, in East Galicia, on the
Dniester; another, about as half as strong (150,000), on the San,
with its back on Przemysl, that tremendous bulwark of Middle
Galicia; and a third, of about 120,000, near Cracow, that almost
equally formidable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place d’armes</span></i>, and key of Western Galicia on
the Upper Vistula.</p>

<p class='c011'>But these numbers do not include a force of eight independent
Cavalry Divisions, each of four Brigades, or four regiments, which
are to be ranked along the Galician frontier at the likeliest points
of danger from the mass-raidings of Russian horsemen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Such were meanwhile the relative dispositions and prospects
on either side of the Austro-Russian border, while, on the other
hand, General Gourko, the hero of the Balkans, was concentrating
at Warsaw an army consisting of the 5th, 6th, 14th, 15th
Corps, and other troops, for the double purpose of holding the
Germans in check, and of operating towards Cracow, on the
Austrian left flank. Moreover, the 2nd Russian Corps from Wilna,
and the 3rd from Riga, seemed to be marshalling on the lower
Niemen with the view of looking over into Königsberg; and of
these Muscovite troops in the Baltic Provinces, no less than in
Western Poland, Baron Beck trusted that the Germans would give
a good and satisfactory account.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a token of his complete satisfaction with the Baron’s lucid
and hopeful exposition of the military situation, the Emperor, at
parting, which was very cordial on His Majesty’s part, conferred
on the distinguished Chief of the Austrian Staff the Red Eagle of
the first class (with swords), and, at the same time, intrusted him
with an autograph missive for his august master at Vienna.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>From my correspondent with the Army of the Baltic at
Königsberg I learn that its mobilisation is now complete, and that
Count Waldersee (who has had a bad fall from his horse, but is
better again) is burning to make a dash across the frontier and
pluck a leaf from the laurel-wreath of General Gourko.</p>

<p class='c011'>The 2nd, or Pomeranian Corps, has meanwhile been appointed
to cope with any descent from the Russian Fleet on the Baltic
shore; while the 9th Corps has been similarly left in Schleswig-Holstein
for the double purpose of frustrating any attempted
landing in that quarter, and also of keeping an eye on Denmark,
whose hearts are practically with the Russians, and who have not
yet forgotten the Redoubts of Düppel.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the other hand, the fortification of Breslau is proceeding at
a rapid rate, Prince Pless and the Duke of Ratibor having lent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>little army of their miners to do the necessary pick and spade
work; while the Army of Silesia (under Prince George of Saxony)
is now echeloned along the railway line, parallel to the Russian
border, between Kreuzburg and Tarnowitz—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utrumque paratus</span></i>—that
is to say, ready either for a front march across the frontier on
Czenstochau, on the Warsaw railway, or for a flanking movement
of support in the direction of Cracow, as occasion may demand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Austrians, we know, are well forward with their concentration;
but owing to the fact that the telegraph wires of the
Russians have now ceased to speak to the outer world, and that
travellers are neither allowed into nor out of Russia, we are still
very much in the dark with regard to their massings and their
movements. To-morrow, however, we mean, if possible, to try and
penetrate a little the veil of this mystery.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>I have just returned from a reconnoitring ride with two squadrons
of the Zieten Hussars, who pushed across the Russian frontier
to within sight of Alexandrovo, the scene of the meeting (of which
I had the good fortune to be an eye-witness) between the old
German Emperor and the late Czar Alexander II., in September
1879, shortly before the signature of the Austro-German Treaty
of Alliance.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a curious coincidence that the first blood in the present
campaign should have been drawn within view of the spot to
which the old Emperor—greatly against the advice of his irate
Chancellor, Bismarck—then hastened to conjure the Czar to desist
from his warlike operations, and assure him, on the other hand, of
his own unalterable determination to keep the peace.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>When we had advanced by the road skirting the railway to
within about a mile of Alexandrovo, a gun attached to a body of
Cossacks (they were of the Don, as I could make out through my
glass, from their blue tunics faced with red) opened fire on us; and
the shell, bursting right in front of our leading troop, killed two
horses and seriously wounded one man (a Wachtmeister). So
having thus caused the enemy to give tongue, we turned bridle
and trotted back, carrying with us the intelligence—the rich fruit
of our reconnaissance—that Alexandrovo was strongly occupied
by troops of all arms. Four sotnias of Cossacks came pelting after
us, but we were quick to outrun these rampaging gentry, to whom
a gun from one of our horse-batteries sent hurtling over a few
shells as a parting souvenir of our hasty yet successful visit.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Paris to-night is in a state of the maddest ferment. For some
days past the public have followed with breathless interest the
rapid development of events on the Russo-German frontier, and
the news of the first skirmish at Alexandrovo, which was printed
in <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Soir</span></cite> this evening, has roused the wildest enthusiasm. Long
and anxious consultations of Ministers have been held daily, and
the Press, with hardly an exception, have been urging on the
Government an immediate declaration of war. Many of the
better-class Germans have been hurrying from Paris—a precaution
which, in the issue, has been shown to be judicious. When
to-day’s news became known, every trade and artifice was
instantly abandoned, and the streets since three o’clock till now
have been thronged by vast crowds, pulsating to a more and more
impassioned excitement. By four o’clock there were literally fifty
thousand people standing in the street with newspapers in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>hands, and every reader was the centre of an excited throng. I was
standing opposite the Vaudeville when a man, bearing a prodigious
bundle of newspapers wet from the press, came staggering swiftly
towards the kiosque. The mob fell upon him, despoiled him of
his burden, and tore open his parcel. There was such a wild
hurry to learn the news, and everybody was so eager to be first
with it, that scores of the journals were torn to ribbons, and
hundreds more were trampled into the mud of the pavement.
The proprietress of the kiosque wrung her hands and wept over
the spectacle, and a gentleman who, by pressure of the crowd,
was forced half-way through one of the windows, vociferously
demanded to know the value of the lost journals. The woman
instantly became business-like, and appraised them roughly at a
hundred francs. The gentleman produced a pocket-book and paid
her twice over, shouting noisily, ‘I present this glorious news to
Paris! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Russie! A bas la Prusse!</span></i>’ That was the first
signal I heard, and in one minute the whole boulevard rang with
frenzied roar on roar. Omnibuses, public carriages, and vehicles
of every description were wedged immovably in the crowd which
thronged the horse-road. The drivers rose from their seats, the
passengers and occupants of the carriages stood up in their places
and roared and gesticulated with the rest. Hundreds of people at
once strove to make speeches, and the combined result was such a
<em>charivari</em> as can scarcely have been heard since the great day of
the Confusion of Tongues.</p>

<p class='c011'>I, myself, had occasion to be thankful for that inconquerable
English accent which has always disfigured my French. A blond
beard and spectacles have always helped me to something of a
German look, and to-day has given the few Germans who happen
to be left in Paris such a scare as the bravest of them is not likely
to forget. At one moment I was surrounded by a wild section of
the mob, whose yells of ‘Down with Prussia!’ were far too
obviously intended to be personal to me. There was nothing for
it but to join in the shouting, and I cried ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la France!</span></i>’ and
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A bas la Prusse!</span></i>’ as lustily as any of them. There was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>instantaneous laugh at the English accent, and I was left alone;
but I could not help thinking what would have happened had I
chanced to learn my French mainly in Berlin rather than in
London. One unfortunate German is reported fatally injured by
the violence of a mob at the Gare du Nord. He had booked for
London, and is said to have carried with him only a small handbag,
and to have left all the rest of his belongings at the hotel, in
his hurry to catch the train for Calais. The director of the Opera
came near to paying with his life for his artistic allegiance to
Wagner. Happily for him he was able to take refuge in the
house of a friend, and the mob contented itself by keeping up a
ceaseless boo-hooing for an hour or more.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EXTRAORDINARY SCENE IN THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The wildest manifestation of the afternoon was in the Place de
la Concorde, where an immense mob fell to dancing about the
statue of Strasburg. Everybody knows the sullen threat with
which that statue has been placarded for so many years. It runs
‘L. D. P. (the initials standing for “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ligue de Patriotes</span>”) <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui
Vive? La France. 1870–18—</span>.’ When the prodigious noise
created by the mob seemed at its highest, it was cloven, as it
were, by a din still greater, and a solid phalanx of men forced a
way into the already crowded square. In the centre of this
phalanx twenty or thirty men marched, bearing a long ladder, the
heads of many of them being thrust between the rungs. In the
middle of the ladder was seated a working painter in a blue
blouse. The man was literally wild with excitement, and was
roaring ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quatre vingt douze</span>’ to a sort of mad, improvised tune,
in which the packed marchers about him joined with the fell
stress of their lungs. In one hand the man flourished aloft a pot
of red paint, with the contents of which he occasionally bedewed
his unheeding companions, some of whom had playfully bedaubed
their own and others’ features, so that they looked as if they had
just come fresh from some scene of massacre. In the other hand
the man held aloft a sheaf of brushes, and in an instant the vast
crowd seized the motive of his presence there, and the meaning of
the rhythmic repetition of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quatre vingt douze!</span>’</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>A way was cleared for the advancing cohort as if by magic.
The ladder, still supporting the painter, was drawn up lengthwise
before the statue, and the workman knelt to his task. At first it
was impossible for him to work, for the bearers of the ladder were
jigging to the tune they sang; but by and by they were persuaded
to quiet, and a very striking and impressive silence fell upon the
crowd. The man, with great deliberation, and with a much firmer
hand than he might have been supposed to own at a time of such
excitement, drew the outline of the figures 9 and 2 in white chalk,
at as great a size as the space of the placard admitted. His movements
were watched with an actually breathless interest, and
when, after the completion of his drawing, he rose and clasped the
knees of the statue in his arms with a joyful and affectionate cry,
two or three people in my neighbourhood sobbed aloud. The man
knelt down again and filled in with red paint the outline he had
drawn. One grim personage, with a squint and a pock-marked
face, who held a short, well-blacked clay between his teeth,
shouldered me at this moment, and said, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est le sang de la
France, ça</span></i>.’ He thought so well of this that he moved away
among the crowd repeating it, nudging his neighbours to call
attention to the saying, and pointing a dirty forefinger at the red
paint of the figures to indicate its meaning. I was waiting for an
outburst of enthusiasm when the figures were completed, but to
my amazement the mob accepted the proclamation they conveyed
with a grave silence, as if it had been in some way authentic and
official, and as if for the first time they recognised the terrible
significance of the hour. Their quiet did not endure long, for one
of their number, having contrived to scramble on to the ladder,
clambered up the statue, and amid great cheers tore from it the
ragged emblems of mourning which have so long disfigured it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came an episode, the like of which would be possible
nowhere but in Paris. The whole thing might have been arranged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>for scenic effect, and the distinguished artist who made the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>
had never, brilliant as his triumphs have been, arrived on the
stage at so opportune a moment, or encountered so overwhelming
a reception. The new-comer was no other than M. Jean de
Reszke, who was on his way to dine with a friend before appearing
as Faust in Gounod’s masterpiece this evening. His coachman
was slowly making way along the crowded road when the
great singer was recognised. He was greeted with a roar of
applause, and a dozen members of the crowd threw open the
closed landau he sat in, while a thousand voices clamoured for the
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</span></cite>. The statue had, at that instant, been denuded of its
last rag of mourning, and M. de Reszke, who had risen bareheaded
in the carriage, was whipped out of it in a trice, and borne,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</span></i>, to the figure, and placed aloft on the pedestal. His
companion, a lady attired with much distinction, was at first
evidently alarmed, but soon gathered the peaceful intention of the
crowd, and seizing the meaning of the moment, she stripped from
her own shoulders a handsome scarlet cloak, and threw it towards
M. de Reszke. It was immediately passed on to him, and he,
with considerable difficulty, and at the risk of a tumble on the
heads of the people below him, succeeded in casting the cloak
over the shoulders of the statue. At this, all the previous noises
which cleft the air of Paris this afternoon seemed as nothing.
The cheering was simply deafening and maddening, and lasted for
full three minutes. At length perfect silence was restored, and
M. de Reszke began to sing the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</span></cite>. He was pale at first,
and obviously unstrung at the spectacle of this prodigious audience,
and for the first few notes his voice was broken and ineffective.
He gathered confidence, however, before he had completed the
singing of the first line, and gave the rest of the song with an
inspiring vigour and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the beginning of the whole extraordinary scene people
had been flocking in from every quarter, and I believe that I am
well within bounds when I say that the singer had an audience of
a hundred and twenty thousand. The chorus was one of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>stupendous and moving things which can ever have been heard
by human ears. It rose from the densely-packed mass of humanity
in one amazing roll and roar of sound, and its echoes came
straggling faintly from the Rue de Rivoli and the Tuileries Gardens,
from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avénue des Champs Elysées</span>, from the Rue Royale,
from the Pont de la Concorde, and the embankment on the further
side of the river. When the whole song was finished it was
redemanded, and was sung through again with undiminished relish
both by the soloist and the chorus. Finally, the singer was permitted
to descend from the pedestal, and was escorted to his
carriage. The crowd had taken out the horses, and M. de Reszke
and his companion were drawn away by some hundreds of volunteers.
The great singer’s nationality has made him the idol of
Paris during all the late days of strained expectation. Every night
the Opera-house has been thronged, and every song from his lips
has been received with literal thunders of applause.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The crowd had already begun to thin when the news passed
round that the Ministers were in conclave at the Elysée. I acted
immediately on the first hint I received, and with great difficulty
made my way across the Place. I found myself almost at once
wedged in anew, this time in a streaming current which set steadily
towards the Elysée. The crowd grew vaster every moment, for
by this time all Paris seemed to have been drawn to that quarter
of the town. For a long time there was silence, or what seemed
like it after the torrent of noise which had roared so long in all
ears, but at last the babble of excited tongues began again, and
was intermixed with occasional cries of impatience. These grew
in a steady crescendo, until no single voice was audible. But
before things reached that point I had heard a hundred excited
conjectures as to the course which would be adopted by England
at this crisis. By seven o’clock the patience of the mob was quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>outworn. The building, so far as could be seen from the outside,
was in complete darkness, and the rumour of the meeting of the
Ministers seemed likely to be practically denied. At length, however,
a sudden swell in the storm of sound greeted the appearance
of light at three windows, and certain ill-defined shadows
were seen moving on the blinds. One profile was distinct and
stationary for a moment, and there was a roar of ‘Ribot!’ A minute
later the blind of the centre window was drawn up, the window
itself was thrown open, and the figure of M. Ribot, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, was seen. This apparition was the signal for a
new outburst in which only the name of the President of the
Republic could be distinguished. The air rang with shouts of
‘Carnot! Carnot!’ and M. Ribot having braved this incredible
tempest for a few seconds only, bowed and retired. A minute
later the President himself appeared. From where I stood his
features were invisible, but his attitude was erect, and he stretched
out his right hand with an impressive gesture to command silence.
It was some time before this injunction was obeyed, but when he
was allowed to speak his voice was firm and unusually clear. His
words were few and to the point. ‘Citizens! Germany has
declared war upon the ally of France. Those gentlemen whom
you have appointed as the guardians of the national honour have
debated the serious intelligence which has to-day awakened the
heart of Paris. It is my duty to tell you that there is no dissentient
voice amongst them. France will fulfil her pledges!’
At this point M. Carnot was interrupted by a unanimous outburst
of applause, which made speech impossible for a space of at least
five minutes. Again and again, when it seemed about to quiet
down, it was taken up from distant quarters, and came rolling
along like a wave, again to subside and again to be renewed.
When order was once more restored the President continued:
‘France speaks to-night, and demands of her neighbour that the
menace against her ally shall be withdrawn. She couples with
that a demand for the surrender of those provinces which were
torn from her twenty years ago!’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>There was at this more cheering, and yet more. The President
retired, and a great deluge of rain which had been threatening to
fall all day speedily cleared the streets. The latest and most
important of the day’s events is yet hardly an hour old, but we
seem now to be living in a city of the dumb. Everybody is hoarse
with four hours’ almost continuous shouting, but the popular
excitement is as great as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house of M. Ferry has been guarded by the military, and
only the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</span></i> existing between the troops and the
populace has saved it from attack. At the moment of writing
the Boulevards are again crowded. The reply of Germany is, of
course, a foregone conclusion, but it is awaited with intense
eagerness.</p>

    <div>DRAMATIC RECEPTION OF THE NEWS BY THE GERMAN EMPEROR.</div>
    <div class='c003'>(<em>By Telegraph from our Special Correspondent, Mr. Charles Lowe.</em>)</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Thorn</span>, <em>May 1</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For this morning the Emperor had ordered a review of all the
troops, amounting to about 60,000 men concentrated hereabouts—the
scene of the parade being a long sweep of meadow-land, not
unlike the Champ de Mars at Paris, on the right bank of the
Vistula. His Majesty and his Staff took their stand on a convenient
knoll commanding all the ground, and scarcely had the
serried battalions of the 3d Corps, with their bristling bayonets
glittering in the bright sun, begun to stride along in all their
martial and magnificent array, when the march past was interrupted
by a most dramatic and thrilling incident.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was standing on the outside fringe of the brilliant circle of
His Majesty’s suite, quietly chatting to Dr. von Leuthold, the
Emperor’s body physician, when suddenly we saw an orderly
officer dash up to his Majesty and deliver a message, which we
could discern from the colour of the envelope to be a telegram.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The Emperor tore it open, glanced through the contents, then
looked up, and let his eye wander all round the circle of his suite,
as if to note the impression produced upon their minds by the
news which His Majesty felt had already been intuitively divined
by those about him. ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ja, meine Herren</span></i>,’ he at last said; ‘it is
just as we all expected. This is a telegram from General von
Caprivi; France has declared war against us’ (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Frankreich hat
Uns den Krieg erklärt</span></i>.) There was a moment’s pause, each man
looking at his neighbour to study the effect of this terrible
announcement, and then all eyes were again turned on the
Emperor, who looked a shade paler than before, but not a whit
less calm and resolute.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gentlemen,’ he said at last, ‘this is a serious moment for us all,
but the news dismays just as little as it surprises us. Yet I must
now leave you, for the danger to the Fatherland is much greater
on its western than on its eastern frontier; and where the danger
to the Fatherland is greatest, there also must Germany’s Kaiser be.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine Herren</span></i>, my place as Commander-in-Chief of our armies
here will now be taken by that tried and gallant soldier, my dear
friend and brother, the King of Saxony, who will, I am sure, bring
honour and victory to our arms. One foe at a time is quite enough,
and the sooner we can help our allies to dispose of their invader,
the sooner shall we be able to concentrate all our forces and inflict
a crushing blow on our hereditary enemy (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erbfeind</span></i>), who has
again, in the most wanton manner, broken loose against us.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gentlemen, this is no time for words, when the call to action
is tingling through all our veins, so I will only invoke the blessing
of God upon the course of our arms in this quarter, and hasten
myself to where the peril of our Fatherland is sorest. Adieu, and
may each and all of us do his duty throughout the coming period
of grievous trial and tribulation!’</p>

<p class='c011'>So saying, the Emperor put spurs to his steed and, accompanied
only by his immediate suite, galloped off back to Thorn, receiving
as he went three enthusiastic ‘hochs.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as I am closing this despatch information reaches us from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Berlin of a naval engagement in the Baltic between our fleet and
some Russian ships; but you, in London, will probably hear all
the details before they reach us here.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>With the German Fleet in the Baltic.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>We have been favoured with the following letter, under date
April 30, from Rear-Admiral Philip Colomb, who has been an eye-witness
of the naval operations in the Baltic:—</p>

<p class='c011'>I was at Kiel with my yacht when the news of the attempt on
Prince Ferdinand’s life reached us. The successive telegrams and
published news created the greatest excitement among all classes,
but especially amongst those connected with the navy. Simultaneously
with the news that Russia had crossed the Austrian
frontier, several German cruisers went to sea, and in a day or two
a regular fleet began to assemble in the port. I don’t understand
German, but my wife does, and she told me whenever we met an
eager crowd discussing, that it was all about whether the fleet
would not be kept to defend the place, and the danger of an attack
by the Russian Fleet if the German Fleet did not remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>I thought I had better get out of it, as if such an attack
were made it might be awkward for me. I think my wife was
so excited about it that she wanted to stay where we were and
see it all; but I thought we might see all there was to be seen
in greater safety from the seaside. And then from the conversation
of some German naval officers which my wife overheard, I
gathered that the navy, at least, believe that it would try to carry
war into the enemy’s country. There were, however, great discussions
about some German coast defence vessels that had not
coal supply enough to go up the Baltic, and great arguments as to
what ships would go and what would stay. As every day more
heavy ships arrived and stayed, while only small ones came and
went, I began to think that after all it was most likely that the
Germans would not stay quiet to let the Russians ravage their
coasts. Then, by the time that nine or ten large turret-ships and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>others, besides several smaller ones, had assembled, I understood
that the German armies were about attacking Russia by way of
Königsberg, as well as to the south. I thereupon made sure that
the German fleet would go up in support, even if they were not
ready to do more.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the end of it was that I waited till ten big ships and
five or six smaller ones got under way, and then I did ditto, and
steamed out with them. I was afraid I might be left behind, as
my coal supply did not allow me to go at any speed; but I found
the Germans, after putting their big ships into two lines a good
distance apart, with some of the smaller ones close at hand on each
side, and two or three others a long way in front, steamed quite
slowly along, not more than five or six knots. I went inshore of
them, and kept them in sight a couple of miles off.</p>

<p class='c011'>We passed close to Rügen Island the afternoon succeeding our
departure, and the south end of Bornholm in the night. I made
out that we were steering straight, for Libau, which is about 450
miles from Kiel. We scarcely had seen anything in the shape of
a ship except a couple of homeward-bound English trading
steamers; but on the second morning at daybreak I noticed all
the German ships had been stoking up, and were making an
immense amount of smoke. There was a good deal of signalling
going on between the German flagships—there were two of these
yesterday, one at the head of each line—and one or two of the
cruisers, which sped away nearly out of sight, and then came
slowly back, signalling as they came. The same sort of thing
went on on the third morning, when we had got beyond Dantzig,
with the difference that two German cruisers were seen steaming
up, one from the southward, and one from the south-westward.
The fleet stopped, and a boat from each of these went to the flagship
and returned, after which there was more signalling, and a
boat from every ship went on board the flagship. I suppose the
other Admiral and the captains were in them, but I was too far off
to make certain.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a couple of hours we all went on again slowly as before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>but electric and other lights were flashing about all night,
so that we were very excited, and made sure that something was
in the wind. As a consequence, long before daylight on the
fourth morning we were on deck looking out in all directions,
and with a good head of steam so as to get out of the way in
case of accidents. Sure enough at daybreak there was a great
bank of smoke to the northward, and presently I could make out
a mast or two sticking up. The two German cruisers, which were
five or six miles in front, at once became very busy with their
signals, and soon afterwards the whole fleet formed into a single
line and turned to the westward, not steaming any faster, but
making such clouds of black smoke that they almost hid themselves
from me. It did not seem that the Russian Fleet—I was
not sure whether it was or not—was closing much, but one or two
ships appeared to draw more in front as if to close the two German
cruisers. Presently the other cruisers that had kept closer to the
fleet also drew out in front, but none of them seemed more inclined
to close the strangers than the strangers were to close them.</p>

<p class='c011'>I could not make it out at all. I had always understood that
in a modern naval battle, everybody would immediately run at
everybody else, and this looked so little like the sort of thing that
I was inclined to think that what I saw was only an advance
guard of the Russian Fleet. Yet it looked too large a mass for
that, and my doubts were presently set at rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Signals were made to one of the German cruisers that had
come to us the day before, and she presently turned and slowly
steamed to the southward. She passed us so very close that I took
heart of grace to call out—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Is that the Russian Fleet?’</p>

<p class='c011'>And the answer came back—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh! ye-es, zat is ze Russians—ve sall fight zem! So!’ and
the steamer went on her way.</p>

<p class='c011'>I began to have some sort of an idea that, perhaps, neither fleet
was able to make out the force of the other, and was, therefore,
not in a hurry to bring it to action. And this might easily be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>so. Though the sky was clear overhead and the water quite
smooth, it was misty round the horizon, and so far as the Russian
Fleet was concerned, it seemed to me very likely that even the
advanced German cruisers were not able to discover more than I
could, between the mist and the smoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as I puzzled myself over this, I also thought that, perhaps,
as the main attack of Germany was going on by land, it might be
her game merely to watch the Russian Fleet. For if the Germans
were badly beaten at sea, Russia might be left free to land and cut
their communications. I had never thought of this kind of thing
before, and I quite woke up with a new sort of idea, for I saw quite
well that the Russian Fleet could not do anything unless they first
thoroughly beat the Germans.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Engagement off Dantzig—Sinking of a Russian Torpedo-Boat.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>I was so keen on my new ideas that I wanted to know more
about it, and so steamed well to the N.E. to see what the Russian
Fleet was like. Just as I did so, I saw a very small Russian
steaming away to the south-eastward as if to get the look at
the German Fleet which I was going to get at the Russian. She
was stoking up tremendously, and evidently going at great speed.
Two of the German cruisers in front immediately turned to the
eastward to cut her off, but the plucky little Russian did not seem
to mind; they closed one another very rapidly, and some puffs of
smoke, followed by distant bangs, showed a little game of long
balls. The Russian had evidently much greater speed than the
others, and was drawing them astern, but quite away from her
own fleet or supports of any kind. All of a sudden I saw she was
blowing off steam furiously, and that her speed had slackened, if
not dropped altogether. She began to fire more rapidly, and so
did the Germans. All three were hidden by the cloud of smoke
they raised. My engineer was frightfully excited; he said, ‘It
was one of them new boilers a-priming,’ and that it was all up
with the Russian. Sure enough it was, for all three ships presently
came out of the smoke, the little Russian with the German
flag flying over her own.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE NAVAL BATTLE OFF DANTZIG—THE SINKING OF A RUSSIAN TORPEDO BOAT AND RESCUE OF THE CREW BY AN ENGLISH YACHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>I had got far enough now to see that the Russian Fleet was
much more numerous than the German, but I could only make out
six or seven really big ships. But there were a crowd of small
ones, and behind, eight or nine little things like those we had seen
taking the <em>Excellent’s</em> men for training. I thought it might be
dangerous to get mixed up with such a crowd, so I returned to the
southward and eastward of the German Fleet. I had noticed that
the Russians were steering slowly parallel to the position of the
Germans, and night closed, leaving all things in this position.
Both sides never left off flashing their electric lights up into the
sky and all over the sea, and it really seemed to me as if they must
all be a good deal confused by such things.</p>

<p class='c011'>So matters went on till eleven o’clock, when I made my wife
go below, while I lay down for a sleep on deck. I was awoke at
one o’clock by such a row as never was, the whole German Fleet
was a blaze and a roar of artillery. I supposed, of course, a Russian
torpedo-boat attack, but it was impossible to tell what had
happened,—all one knew was that an attack of some kind had been
made. After a very few minutes the fire began to slacken, and
some of it I noticed, with an unpleasant sensation, was coming my
way. But that, too, soon came to an end. My wife was at that
moment beside me again, and she suddenly cried out, ‘Hark!
what’s that?’ I could hear a rushing and a panting sound
drawing close to us, and then the ball of white foam that I had
seen one night from a torpedo boat. The panting suddenly
stopped, and the rushing became fainter and fainter until out of
the dark came a torpedo-boat evidently making for the yacht,
but very slowly. Just as she was coming alongside there was
a sort of wild cry, and I saw she had suddenly gone to the
bottom. Our little boat was down in an instant, and I got hold
of somebody floating at once, while the men helped in two Russian
sailors. I found I had hold of a Russian officer, but he was
evidently unable to help himself. I could not get him in but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>we drew him alongside and the men carried him up. I then saw
that the poor chap was badly wounded in the shoulder. No
one on board could speak Russian, but we laid him down on
the deck, and my wife threw herself down beside him with her
scissors and began to cut away his dress, while she cried to her
maid to bring her water and linen. It was of no use, however. The
poor fellow was quite unconscious and bleeding to death. It
was all over in ten minutes, and we could do nothing but reverently
commit the body to the deep. Our other two Russians were
unwounded, but could not make us understand anything. We put
them next day into an English vessel bound to Revel.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE NAVAL BATTLE OFF DANTZIG—WOUNDED RUSSIANS ON BOARD THE ENGLISH YACHT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We were eager enough in the morning to see what had happened,
but there seemed to be no ships absent. One of the battleships
was, however, evidently very much down by the head, and
in the course of the morning we saw her quit the fleet for the
southward. Everything else was, in fact, in the same position on
both sides, and it was evident that a regular battle was no nearer.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>I presently saw a vessel—I think it must have been one of
the German Emperor’s yachts, from the look of her—coming up
fast from the southward, and as soon as she got near enough, she
began making a long signal. Almost directly, the German ships
all turned towards her. They stopped when she reached them,
and after she had sent a boat to the flagship, the whole fleet put
on good speed, and stood nearly due west, as if for Kiel again. I
could not keep up with them, so I am going to Colberg to post
this and hear the news.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>P.S.</em>—I have learnt at Colberg that the Emperor’s yacht
brought news of the declaration of war by France, and orders for
the whole German fleet to return to the Jahde at full speed, to
avoid being caught between the Russian and French fleets. The
Germans say they sank several of the Russian torpedo-boats, and
that they had their broadside nets out. Only the <em>Oldenburg</em>
was struck by a torpedo, the one I saw. She got into Kiel all
right, but was badly damaged. It is said that the Russians are
spread along the whole German Baltic coast, and descents are
expected.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The declaration of war by France was the inevitable result
of the action of Germany in regard to Russia. Events, indeed,
have marched with a ruthless and tragical directness ever since
the day, barely four weeks since, when Prince Ferdinand narrowly
escaped death from Russian intrigue. In Germany, least of all,
can there have been any doubt as to the course France would take.
The experience of 1870 must have made abundantly clear to her
what would be the outcome of the scenes on the Paris boulevards
which our Correspondent has so graphically described. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>powerful enemies on either flank, Germany cannot afford to adhere
to punctilio. With the double contest on her hands she cannot now
hope to bring into the battle-fields superior numbers, as in the wars
of 1866 and 1870–71; prospects of success, as her chiefs well know,
lie for her in promptitude of action, in blows struck in unexpected
places, in carefully planned efforts to bewilder and divide the
forces opposed to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>To strike anywhere at the eastern frontier of the French
adversary, barred as it is with almost continuous fortresses from
Verdun to Belfort, must necessarily involve prolonged delay, even
if the heavy siege-work which is inevitable should be ultimately
successful. True, Germany will no doubt be able to foil any
offensive on the part of France from the base of the fortified
eastern frontier, but merely to do this would be to confine herself
to that defensive which is intensely repugnant to her military
character. Yet her only opening for the offensive, unless she
were to force or obtain by diplomacy a right of way for her armies
through neutral territory, of necessity must be by that eastern
frontier of France which is coterminous with her own territory,
and through or over the chain of fortresses which loom out sullenly
from behind that frontier line.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ideal line of invasion of France by Germany obviously
lies through Belgium. It would turn and negative the chain of
French fortresses on the eastern frontier, and give the shortest
route through hostile territory to the French capital. Belgium is
neutral ground; her neutrality guaranteed by the Great Powers;
but how vain a pretence is this guarantee is already proved by
the latest news from our Berlin Correspondent. It is believed (he
states on credible authority), that Germany has been successful in
exacting or obtaining from Belgium a secret Convention, whereby
the armies of the Empire shall be free to traverse the former State,
and to utilise for their purposes the Belgian railway system. The
advantages of this arrangement may be said to fairly compensate
Germany for the numerical superiority of the French forces over
those which she herself is able to bring into the field.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The German plan of campaign, as explained by our Berlin
Correspondent, is as follows:—Seven of the twenty Army Corps
are engaged on the Russian frontier under the King of Saxony.
To cope with France there remain thirteen corps, with a proportionate
number of independent cavalry brigades. The First Army,
under the command of Prince Albrecht of Prussia, is to advance
through Belgium by Verviers, Liége, Namur, and Charleroi, and
cross the northern frontier of France between Maubeuge and
Rocroy, at and about Hirson. The fortresses on the French
northern frontier east of Maubeuge are of little account, and there
are none on the section specified. The Ardennes and Eifel districts
are regarded as affording considerable protection to the line
of communication as far as the frontier, and a further protection
will presently be mentioned. It is unfortunate that between Aix
and Liége there is available but one line of railway, but the accommodation
is copious on either side of this section, several lines
being serviceable right to the frontier.</p>

<p class='c011'>This First Army is to consist of six Army Corps, the Guards,
7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 16th being those whose respective provinces
are nearest to the region of concentration west of Cologne.
Among its Corps-commanders are such men as Generals Meerscheidt-Hullessem,
Von der Burg, Von Versen, Albedyll, Von Loë,
all distinguished names in the war of 1870–71. The Emperor
himself, who of course is Commander-in-Chief of all the German
forces in both fields of operations, accompanies this army, after
leaving the eastern frontier with General von Schlieffen, the Chief
of the great General Staff, and a number of the German princes.
The cavalry commander is General the Grand Duke Frederick of
Baden.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Second Army is to consist of the 9th, 14th, and 15th
Army Corps. The course of action prescribed for this is to
advance from Trèves through Luxembourg, with the consent of
the Grand Duke, following the Trèves-Brussels railway as far as
Arlon, whence it is to approach the French frontier between the
fortress of Montmedy and Sedan, and in this vicinity, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>covering the communications of the main army, draw on itself
the attention of the French field army presumably lying behind
the northern section of the French frontier fortresses from about
Verdun southward, so hindering it from marching westward to
swell the forces opposing themselves to the main German army
moving by Namur and Charleroi. Having accomplished this
‘holding’ operation, whether with or without a battle, it is to
disengage, move westward below Mezieres, and approach that
army after it has crossed the frontier. In performing this
arduous task the Second Army will have to encounter the
physical difficulties of the Eastern Ardennes, and protect its line
of communication running perilously near the frontier. To aid
in this work, severe at once, and delicate, it is to be furnished
with a strong cavalry force, under the command of Lieutenant-General
von Kleist.</p>

<p class='c011'>If from behind the curtain of their eastern frontier fortresses
the French are bent on taking the offensive, German strategists,
says our Correspondent, freely recognise the impossibility, owing
to the diversion through Belgium of the bulk of the German force,
of hindering them from over-running Alsace and Lorraine up
toward the left bank of the Upper Rhine, where the German
fortresses would give them halt. Yet such an advance, if
attempted, they will not find quite an unchequered promenade.
In Lorraine, Metz, for instance, will somewhat interfere with free
transport by rail. In the chain of frontier forts the French
engineers have designedly left between Toul and Epinal an undefended
gap or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trouée</span></i> of considerable breadth. Because of the
fortifications of the second line of defence this specious interval is
greatly in the nature of a trap, but its debouche toward France
nevertheless needs to be watched by a strong field force on either
flank.</p>

<p class='c011'>Confronting this gap, on the plateau behind the Meurthe, between
Luneville and St. Die, with advanced posts about Ramberville, and
a strong wide-stretching cordon of cavalry still further forward, the
Third German Army, consisting of the 13th Würtemberg, and 1st
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and 2d Bavarian Army Corps, under the command of Leopold,
Prince Regent of Bavaria, is to take up its position. The Prince
is to make demonstrations from time to time to hold in position
the French field-forces on its flanks and rear. If threatened in
palpably overwhelming strength, the army has a line of retreat
across the Middle Vosges open, striking back in the passes as it
retires. Should the gap be judged practical by-and-by because of
the withdrawal of the French field-forces to participate in the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> in the interior of France, instructions how to act will, of
course, be sent from the Imperial Headquarters. As soon as the
mobilisation of the active army is complete, the Landwehr is to
be mobilised with all speed to the last man, and got into readiness
to reinforce the armies already in the field, for the Fatherland
will be contending against heavy odds, and will need the devotion
of all its sons. It should be said that the 2d (Pomeranian) Army
Corps is retained in Germany for the protection of the northern
coast.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE FRENCH PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>While these preparations have been made by Germany, France
has not been idle. According to the latest telegrams from Paris,
the original plan of campaign devised by the French Etat-major
has undergone modification, now that it has become virtually
certain that the main German advance is to be made through
Belgium. The contingency that a contributory stroke may be
made in that direction had, indeed, been in a measure provided
for originally. To meet it four Army Corps were to take up an
initial position in the fortress-bound triangle, La Fere-Soissons-Laon.
Two were to be on the Meuse between Mouzon and Dun
to confront a possible German entrance between Montmedy and
Longwy. Three were allotted to the frontier on the extreme
south-east, since Italy is a member of the Triple Alliance. The
garrison of the Government of Paris was not to move. The
remaining ten corps were destined for the eastern frontier from
Verdun to Belfort.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>But these arrangements have been dislocated now that it
has become apparent that a great German army is gathering on
the eastern frontier of Belgium, with plain intent to strike for
Northern France through that State. General Saussier, who
holds the high position of Commander-in-Chief of all the French
armies, and the chief of staff, General Miribel, have had the
sudden task of planning other dispositions. No fewer than seven
Army Corps, the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 9th, 10th, and 11th, all furnished
by the most adjacent territorial military ‘regions,’ are now
to constitute the army to be massed in and beyond the La Fere-Soissons-Laon
triangle, and beyond toward the northern frontier
west of the Givet salient, and this army Saussier himself is to
command. An army of two corps, the 5th and 6th, commanded
by General Carre de Bellemar, is to line the Meuse on the northeast,
as in the original disposition. Seven corps, the 7th, 8th,
12th, 13th, 17th, and 18th, are to constitute the field forces and
garrisons of the eastern frontier, divided into two armies, the
northern army of three corps commanded by General de Galliffet,
the southern of four by the Duc de Auerstädt (Davoust). Three
corps, the 14th, 15th, and 16th, all of south-eastern domicile, are
to watch the Italian frontier from Albertville to Mentone, under
the chief command of General Thomassin. The French mobilisation
was set about appreciably later than the German; but once
begun, no time has been lost, and the rapidity with which it has
progressed and is being completed has surprised even those who
were most strongly convinced of the regeneration of military
France.</p>

<p class='c011'>While, thus armed and fortified, France and Germany stand
watching each other across the Rhine, we in England remain in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>suspense profounder than we have experienced any time this side
of the Napoleonic wars. The political excitement during the last
few days has been intense, and at the prospect now imminent of
the violation of the neutrality of Belgium has set the country by
the ears. The people, the Press, and the politicians of England are
deeply stirred, and the crowded public meeting, called at a few
hours’ notice, which was held yesterday in London is a proof, if
proof were needed, that the Government will be compelled by
popular feeling to strain every nerve to avert from ‘gallant little
Belgium’ the violation of that neutrality, to the maintenance of
which Britain stands pledged. The opposition press, ablaze with
zeal for the honour of England now that there seems an opening
for the charge of supineness against the Government, shrieks in
scathing leaders that the voice of the nation should enforce on the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fainéant</span></i> Ministry its imperative duty of addressing vehement
remonstrances to the Great Teuton power. The journals favourable
to the Government cannot refrain from addressing strong
representations to the Cabinet regarding the uncertain future of
Antwerp if Belgium is again to become the cockpit of Europe, and
the standing menace to Britain which that great fortress will
become if it pass into other hands than those of the Belgians.
The House, too, appears equally moved, and not a day has passed
but at the question hour a rattle of shrewish interpellations has
been shot across the House at the target of the Treasury Bench.
The inexplicable composure of Her Majesty’s Ministers has, however,
at length, broken down before the insistence of the Opposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Tuesday, when the German mobilisation over against the
eastern frontier of Belgium was well forward, and when there
remained no longer any doubt that the army gathering there would
traverse that State, Sir William Harcourt rose in his place, every
eye in the House centred on him, and with portentous earnestness
of aspect and manner, demanded that the Leader of the House
should name an early day for a debate on ‘the grave international
questions and eventualities connected with the imminent violation
of the neutrality of Belgium, and the attitude of the ministry in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>relation to those questions and eventualities.’ Sir William reseated
himself with, indeed, a brow of care and gravity, as
beseemed a statesman dealing with a momentous crisis; but the
lower section of his expressive visage mantled with a conscious
complacency which seemed to indicate a conviction that he had
propounded something in the nature of a ‘settler’ for this apparently
inertest of Governments. ‘Take to-morrow, if you like,’ drawled
the Leader of the House without rising, and then he actually and
visibly yawned. The smirk faded out of Sir William’s face at the
roar of laughter, irrepressible on the part of the Liberals and
Conservatives alike, which followed Mr. Balfour’s drawl and
yawn.</p>

<p>A SCENE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS—SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT QUESTIONS THE GOVERNMENT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The Opposition papers have vied in vituperation of Mr. Balfour’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</span></i>, which they described as ‘insolence,’ ‘impertinence,’
and ‘insult.’ One provincial journal congratulates Sir William
Harcourt on his self-restraint in having refrained from pulling Mr.
Balfour’s nose, and another, with startling novelty, compares the
latter to Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. But yesterday’s
scene in the House has shown, at least, that the Government,
though composed, has not been indifferent. It must have been
galling to many of the hot-brained to have observed that when in
the afternoon Mr. Balfour lounged into the crowded House, he
showed no symptoms of being crushed, or even perturbed, by this
avalanche of invective. In opening the debate, the ordinarily
bland and gentle Sir William Harcourt displayed a truculent
aggressiveness which startled all listeners, so foreign was it to his
previously disclosed nature. When he had finished, and the dust
had settled a little, Mr. Balfour slowly rose. He spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Her Majesty’s Government were confidentially informed a year
ago, both by Germany and Belgium, that those two States had
concluded a secret convention, in terms of which, in case of war
between Germany and France, Belgium was to permit German
troops to pass through her territory and to utilise her railways.
It no doubt is a question whether Belgium has any right thus to
permit the violation of her neutrality guaranteed by the Great
Powers, but the question in the circumstances is an abstract one.
Who is to intervene to hinder her? Not Germany, who has made
a bargain with her for the right of violation. Not France, who
violated Belgian neutrality with impunity in 1870, and who, if
she now is ready in time, will, in her anxiety to fight the Germans
outside the French frontier, assuredly violate it again—if, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the act can be termed violation when the neutrality is virtually dead
already by Belgium’s own act. In eastern Europe there is other
business on hand just now, than solicitude for the protection of
Belgian neutrality. Does the right hon. baronet propose that
England should undertake this task single-handed, and, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>,
force Belgium against her will to co-operate with us in retrieving
the neutrality she has already surrendered? We should, and in
hostility to Belgium, stand alone, in an attempt to make good the
guarantee we entered into conjointly with other Powers; and I
say frankly that this is not a Quixotic Government. But when
we were informed, in strict confidence, of this convention, we took
measures for the interest and protection of Great Britain. Those
measures may give umbrage in certain quarters; that we cannot
help. We claimed and obtained from Belgium the right to occupy
and garrison the great fortress of Antwerp if the convention
alluded to should become operative, and to hold that fortress
pending the solution of the momentous events now clearly
impending on the Continent of Europe. We recognised the
impossibility of enduring in Antwerp a possibly hostile neighbour
so close to our own street-door, and we resolved and have secured
the right to be our own neighbour over the way in the troublous
times approaching. During the past week we have been quietly
and unostentatiously making some needful preparations. These
are now so forward that I may inform the House that a complete
division of British infantry and artillerymen 15,000 strong will be
embarked at sundry of our ports on the day after to-morrow, and
will land at Antwerp on the following morning, being conveyed
swiftly in steam transports under the convoy of the Channel
Squadron. The division will sail fully equipped with an adequate
supply of stores. Its commander will be a soldier whose name
and fame are familiar to us all; I refer to that distinguished officer,
Sir Evelyn Wood. The Belgians hand us over Antwerp as it
stands, with fortress, artillery, ammunition, and all appliances for
defensive operations which we fervently pray and trust that there
shall be no occasion to engage in.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The cheering throughout Mr. Balfour’s short but pregnant
speech had been frequent and hearty; when he sat down it swelled
in volume and force that seemed to shake the roof. Sir William
Harcourt, with the best grace he could assume, professed himself
satisfied, and the debate collapsed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late last night it was reported that the Government asked and
received powers to enlist 20,000 men, and to call out for duty a
large number of militia battalions.</p>

    <div>DEFEAT OF THE RUSSIANS.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Alexandrovo (in Russian Poland)</span>, <em>May 2</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As a result of the scouting ride undertaken by a squadron of
Zieten Hussars from this place, as mentioned in a late telegram of
mine, it was resolved at Headquarters here (and the decision was
sanctioned by the Emperor before his return to Berlin <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i>
for the Rhine) to make another reconnaissance, this time in force
with the view, if possible, of ousting the Russians from Alexandrovo
and possessing ourselves of that important frontier position; for
that the best defensive is an energetic offensive is a maxim which
still forms the chief guiding principle of German warfare.</p>

<p class='c011'>To-day, accordingly, a force consisting of the 6th Infantry
Division, under Lieutenant-General Von Schnabeltitz, a combined
Cavalry Brigade (Zieten Hussars and 3d, or Kaiser Alexander II.
von Russland, Uhlans), under Major-General von Säbelschlucker;
and two sections (comprising six batteries each, of six guns) under
Major Count von Donnerkeil; to-day, I say, this force, starting at
dawn, made a rapid march eastward, and was soon across the little
stream forming the frontier, where the Russian outposts—who
seemed to be singularly supine—were quickly driven in by a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>shots from our advance guard. From a wounded Muscovite, who was
shot in the thigh and had to be left behind by his comrades, we
learned that Alexandrovo was, after all, not quite so strongly held
as our late reconnaissance had led us to suppose, its entire
defending force consisting of only one Infantry Brigade, under
Major-General Grodnovodsky, with several guns, a few sotnias of
Cossacks, and two squadrons of Dragoons. Perceiving, therefore,
that we were considerably stronger in all our arms—especially our
infantry and artillery—we made haste to push on towards our
objective, and managed, by advancing at the double, to gain the
rising ground on our side of Alexandrovo before the enemy could
anticipate our design. But it was a close race; nor was it won
by us without a sharp brush, involving several casualties on either
side, between one of our Hussar squadrons, under Rittmeister Von
Rummelsburg, and a sotnia of Don Cossacks, who were very
bravely led, whoever was their commander.</p>

<p class='c011'>Von Rummelsburg, who was sent forward with his Hussars to
feel the ground in front of our infantry, had just gained the brow
of the acclivity in question when he perceived the Cossacks
making for the same vantage-ground from the opposite side, and at
once charged down upon them in the gallantest style, emptying a few
Russian saddles even before the shock, for his regiment was one of
those that had been experimentally armed with the new combination
lance-rifle—the invention of an ingenious locksmith at
Potsdam—of which the Emperor became enamoured last year, and
several of the brave Cossacks had thus succumbed to the impact
of lead before they could come within stabbing distance of the
equally fatal German spear—a notable feature this in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin de siècle</span></i>
warfare, and one that is likely to impress itself still more vividly
in the course of the present campaign.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cossacks being thus flung back on their infantry, whose
movements were of an unaccountably slow and confused kind, our
guns dashed up to the top of the bluff, which had formed the bone
of contention between us and the Muscovites, and, unlimbering
like lightning, began to blaze away at the retreating horsemen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>with shrapnel which seemed to do further execution amongst
them. Then, laying their pieces at long range and loading with
percussion-fuse shells, Donnerkeil’s gunners hastened to rain a
terrific torrent of destructive projectiles on the railway station of
Alexandrovo, behind which Grodnovodsky’s infantry had retired
for temporary shelter. His guns planted on a rising bit of orchard
ground on his left, were energetically enough worked against our
batteries, but did us little or no harm, as the Prussian artillerists,
always very careful in their selection of a firing position even in
the tumult of action, showed little more than the mere muzzles of
their guns over the crest of the land-wave, in the rear dip of which
the infantry of the 6th Division were lying prone and scatheless
in eager readiness to rush on as soon as the cannon of the Russians
should be reduced to silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor had they long to wait for this result, for the furious
artillery duel had barely lasted an hour when Grodnovodsky’s
guns were seen to limber up—such of them as had escaped dismounting—and
lumber off; and then our impatient battalions,
throwing out their first fighting line, fanlike, in skirmishing order,
with supports behind and reserves following, all in as machine-like
and magnificent order as at a field-day on the Tempelhof Common,
began to push forward, the guns firing over their heads all the
while as they swarmed down the Russian-ward slope of our
eminence and across the rye and potato fields, still rather wet
and cloggy from last night’s rain, in front of Alexandrovo. The
Russian infantry attempted to debouch from their shell-shattered
position behind the railway station and other adjacent buildings,
and deploy in line of purpose to stem our steadily advancing tide;
but our guns, which were still able to pound away over the heads
of our own battalions, played dreadful havoc with their shrapnel
charges among Grodnovodsky’s out-manœuvred troops, who were
also mown down in great numbers by the fearful fire of our
magazine-rifles, of which the murderous volleys appeared to inspire
our opponents with a feeling of panic as unfamiliar to them as the
effects of smokeless powder; and, for the first time probably in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the military history of Russia, the soldiers of the Czar positively
turned tail and fled before superior numbers and unaccustomed
terrors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet the dead and wounded whom they left behind amply
attested the tenacious bravery with which they had fought; and
the losses on our side were not insignificant, including, as they did,
the death of Colonel von Degenzieher and Lieutenant Prince Zu
Sonnenwalde-Drachenfels-Schinckenstein, a young man as brave
as he was handsome, both of the 8th Brandenburg (Prince
Frederick Charles’s) Infantry Regiment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, the loss of these two gallant officers, and other brave men
on our side, was more than compensated for by the capture of
Alexandrovo (into which we marched, or rather rushed, with
colours flying, and drums beating) with its rich accumulation of
railway rolling stock, which will be far more precious to us than
acres upon acres of military stores.</p>

<p class='c011'>How in the Heaven’s name the Russians could ever have failed
to concentrate, at the very outset of this war, a more formidable
defending force around so very important a strategic point as
Alexandrovo, is a bewildering puzzle even to those who have busied
themselves with the systematic study of the Russian character;
but, at any rate, there <em>they</em> were and here <em>we</em> are, thanks to the
incredible supineness of our foes, their contemptible outpost service,
the audacity and sudden swiftness of our movements, and the
disastrous surprise which we then sprung upon them.</p>

he will be able to commit it to the wires.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not yet twenty-four hours since the victorious 6th Division
of the German Army occupied this place, and already it is bristling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>on the Warsaw, or south-eastern side, with a most formidable line
of earthworks, thanks chiefly to the marvellous exertions of the
Engineer Battalion of the 3d Corps, which was quick to arrive
here by rail yesterday, within an hour of our triumph—the first of
the campaign. But, indeed, the spades of all our infantry have
also been incessantly at work since they piled their rifles here, it
being thought certain that the Russians will endeavour to get a
double amount of work out of their cranky, creaking mobilisation
machine, and hasten to deliver a desperate counter-attack, with
the view of repairing the disastrous error they have committed—an
error that has placed us in possession of a railway base of
operations of incalculable price. Among other spoils we captured
123 railway waggons of various kinds, and nine locomotives, which,
added to the rolling stock that is hourly pouring in from the
direction of Thorn, with the remainder of the German Army of the
Vistula, now rapidly massing here, render us certain of the means
of transport in the event of our deciding to carry the torch of
invasion deeper into the heart of Russia.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is true that the railway from here to Warsaw consists of
only a single track, but the gauge, unlike that of all Russian lines
on the right bank of the Vistula, is of the ordinary European size,
and that in itself is a tremendous advantage for us. Our Army of
the Baltic, under Count Waldersee, will be hampered in its forward
movements into Russia, if it decides to push across the frontier
also, by the fact that the line from Eydtkuhnen is a broad-gauge
one, though, indeed, it is understood that the General Staff—prescient
in all things—has also made provision for adapting the
axles of German lines to the broader gauge of Russian; but, on the
other hand, the Army of Silesia, under Prince George of Saxony,
will enjoy the same transport facilities as ourselves, if it can only
manage to effect, like us, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied à terre</span></i> on the Warsaw and Vienna
line, and we are anxiously awaiting news of its movements.</p>

Berlin to the Rhine amid an unparalleled scene of excitement and
enthusiasm, came a despatch reporting that Prince George of
Saxony, by dint of forced marches of immense difficulty through
the devious moors and marsh-grounds east of Rosenberg and
Tarnowitz on the Kreuzburg-Tarnowitz line, had also succeeded in
surprising the Russians at Czenstochau, on the Warsaw-Vienna
Railway, and, capturing that important place, after a desperate but
unavailing resistance on the part of its defenders, who, incredible
to relate, consisted of not much more than its usual garrison—a
brigade of infantry and two brigades of cavalry. But the German
losses here were much more serious than with us yesterday, one
infantry regiment in particular—the 22d Silesian—being more
than decimated in its desperate, yet successful, endeavours to drive
the enemy from a clump of wood, surmounted by a battery—a
proof that it still continues to be animated by the heroic spirit of
its name-chief, Field-Marshal James Keith, whilom of Inverugie
and Dunnottar, in the Kingdom of Scotland, who, at its head, met
his own death, under the eye of Frederick the Great, when saving
the surprised right flank of the Prussian Army from utter annihilation
by the Austrians at Hochkirch in the Lausitz.</p>

<p class='c011'>These two engagements, then, though on a smaller scale, have
been the Wörth and Spichern of the present war; and it now only
remains to be seen whether we shall be able to improve upon
these initial successes—which were due to a great extent, I repeat,
to the exceeding swiftness and daring of our own movements, as
compared with the incredible slowness of our foes, and the faultiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>of their mobilisation process, no less than to the fact that
the Russians, imagining the Germans would never dare invade
Poland, but remain upon their guard and form a flanking reserve
support in Silesia to their Austrian allies, directed the main stream
of their mobilisation further to the east, towards Dragomiroff’s
line of hostile advance upon Lemberg and the Carpathian Passes
to the south thereof at Stryj.</p>

<p class='c011'>How Gourko, who is known to be still at Warsaw, though the
bulk of his forces must now be well in front of him, will endeavour
to cope with the situation thus so suddenly created for him, is
naturally the question which occupies all minds here, and it
cannot be very long before his intentions are made manifest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the telegrams from Galicia, where our Austrian
allies have concentrated the bulk of their forces, are not quite so
encouraging, indicating, as they do, less initiative and promptitude
of action on their part, as well as considerable difference of
opinion in the minds of the Corps and Army Commanders as to
whether they ought to remain on the defensive, or espouse an
audacious policy of invasion like ourselves, and essay to beard the
lion, or rather the bear, in his den.</p>

<p class='c011'>Count von Schlieffen, who proves to be as amiable a man as
he is an able Chief of the Staff, tells me that news reached the
German Headquarters this afternoon of a tremendous conflict
between no fewer than five Cavalry Divisions, three on the
Russian side and two on the Austrian, somewhere near Brod, on
the Volhynian frontier—a conflict which resulted, as it could
scarcely otherwise have done from the relative proportion of
numbers, in the total defeat of the Austro-Hungarian horsemen.
The latter, it seems, were covering the movements of the 3d
Austrian Corps, which had been appointed to head an advance in
the direction of Dubno; and when they had been overthrown in
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> which, in its colossal magnitude, recalled the mounted
conflicts of the Crusaders, the victorious Russians, rallying and
reforming line, swept down upon a detached portion of the
Austrian infantry, regardless of the smokeless volleys from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Mannlicher repeating rifle, and made awful havoc among the
sturdy men from the Steiermark, taking one whole battalion
prisoners, including, it is rumoured, the colonel of the regiment,
the 27th, who is none other than Count Hartenau, better known
as Prince Alexander of Battenberg, ex-Prince of Bulgaria—a
wonderful piece of luck, indeed, for the Russians, if the rumour
proves true.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later despatches confirm the rumour of Prince Alexander’s
capture by the Russians, and add that, when the news became
known at Dragomiroff’s headquarters—which are said to be at
Dubno—there was almost as much jubilation as when the intelligence
of Napoleon’s surrender flew like wildfire around the
German lines at Sedan.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ex-Bulgarian Prince is to be sent to St. Petersburg, where
rooms are being already prepared for him at the Katherinenhof,
and meanwhile he has been allowed to retain his sword in order
that his unforgiving and exultant cousin, the Czar, may have the
satisfaction of receiving it from the humiliated captive’s own
hands—a picture that will eclipse in interest all the romantic incidents
which have already marked the Prince’s strangely chequered
career.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The German Army of the Vistula has just inflicted on the
Russians another Plevna, and they are now in full retreat towards
Warsaw. Such, in brief, is the result of the sanguinary night
battle of which I have just been a witness. The Russians were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the first to practise night attacks as a means of obviating the
dreadful losses certain to result from magazine-rifle fire during the
day, but they will long have cause to remember their first serious
application of the nocturnal principle of modern warfare.</p>

<p class='c011'>By seven o’clock last night the 3d and 4th German Corps
had completed their concentration at and near this place, and,
after extending the lines of entrenchment begun by the 6th
Division on capturing Alexandrovo, had gone into fireless bivouac
on both sides of the railway line, their tents extending for about a
couple of miles in either direction. Several reconnaissances
executed by us during the day had elicited that the Russians
were marshalling in great force at a place called Waganiek, and
were receiving reinforcements from the right bank of the Vistula,
by means of a pontoon bridge which had been thrown across the
stream a little higher up, at Dobrowniki; but, owing to the dense
masses of cavalry which hovered on their front, concealing their
movements as a stage curtain hides from view the shifting of the
scenes in a theatre, it was impossible for our scouts to bring back
more definite information. One item, however, of their intelligence,
gathered from a captured Cossack, had a special interest for
us, to wit, that the Russian forces immediately in front of us consisted
mainly of the 5th and 6th Corps, with part of the 4th
(including the relics of Grodnovodsky’s Brigade), and were under
the personal command of General Gourko, the hero of the Balkans.
On the strength of this information it was decided to attack
Gourko before he got his preparations complete, and for this purpose
to break bivouac, and start in quest of him at the dawn of
day, as Prince Frederick Charles had done with Benedek at
Sadowa.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had spent the evening with a particular friend of mine,
Captain von Jagdkönig, of Stülpnagel’s Brandenburg Infantry
Regiment, and was just on the point of setting out with him on a
visit of inspection among the fore-posts, when a Uhlan dashed up
with the intelligence that there were signs of a mysterious commotion
in front, and that something was audible in the otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>noiseless night like the distant rumbling of waggon and cannon
wheels. Anon other messengers from the front came spurring in
with similar news, and as the general purport of all these ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meldungen</span></i>’
could no longer be doubted, the bugles were at once set to
work, and presently all the silent bivouacs, taking up the shrilling
war-note one after the other, like the multiplication of a distant
echo, were resonant with the thrilling call to arms; and thanks to
the severe training in the discipline of ‘alarms’ which the German
army has been put through by the present Emperor since his
accession to the throne, the army of the Vistula had all started
from its sleep and was standing in perfect battle array, with its
face to the suspected foe, within ten minutes of the first trumpet
summons.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night was intensely dark, the moon having just gone
down behind an impenetrable bank of pitchy clouds, and all
fighting seemed to be utterly out of the question. Presently,
however, the inky darkness all around us was pierced, one may
almost say scattered, by a sudden blaze of light, which, appearing
to possess all the illuminating power of the mid-day sun, flashed
lightning-like upon us its blinding beams from the murky forehead
of the midnight sky. ‘The electric light!’ ran from mouth
to mouth, after a moment’s bewildered pause, while every one
instinctively shaded his eyes from the glare of this all-irradiating
and all-penetrating lamp which modern Science had thus hung up
to facilitate the work of slaughter, as if the very sun refused to
look any longer upon human carnage. For some moments the
more than mile-long rays of this blinding ball of light, this
detective bull’s-eye of modern science, swept round the horizon in
front of it, as if uncertain where to fix its focus—now shooting
beyond, now falling short of us, and anon settling on us and
suffusing us with a sea of dazzling light. Presently another, and
yet another such luminary burst forth from elevations of pretty
equal distances in front of us, and the process of their groping
about for our lines revealed to us dense masses of grey and dark-green
coated battalions picking their cautious way down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>distant slopes in front of us. For the electric light has this disadvantage,
that in flinging its beams about to discover the locality
of foes, it frequently at the same time unveils the whereabouts of
friends. This was the case here, but our gunners were on the
alert, and next time the focus of the light, in its jerky search-movement,
fell on the Russian troops in the course of their
stealthy advance towards us, we opened the concert with a screaming
chorus of shells, accompanied by a rattling orchestration of
small-arms. Nor had we long to wait for the antiphone; for next
time the search-light managed to flood us with its blinding
effulgence, the Russian batteries, which had been planted on the
same elevations, gave lusty voice, and bellowed away at us in
most leonine fashion, though their projectiles, being aimed at
much too long a range, flew high over our heads and left us scatheless.
Not so, however, the rifle-rain of our enemies, which, first
in intermittent showers, and then in a steady downpour, began to
fall among our ranks with deadly effect; and the word was passed
from flank to flank for all the infantry to lie down and court the
shelter of our field entrenchments, which crested the ridge of our
line of battle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between us and the Russian infantry there intervened a depression
in the ground, a little deeper than that which separates
Mont St. Jean from Belle Alliance; but what enhanced the value
of this ground to our foes was the fact that their batteries in the
rear, planted as they were on the electric light elevations overlooking
the terrain, could fire over the heads of their infantry till
the latter was pretty well within storming distance of our position,
much in the same way as the guns of the 6th Division had
been able to do the other day on the occasion of our first engagement,
which resulted in the capture of Alexandrovo.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Russians advanced against us with a steady, stolid courage
worthy of the men who had essayed to capture the Sand Bag
Battery and storm the redoubts of Plevna; and as the fitful flashes
of the electric light revealed to us, for a few moments at a time,
their dense battalions advancing and deploying into the fighting-lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>demanded by modern tactics and the rules of fire-discipline, I
could not help thinking of that cold and dark November morning
when, without the aid of the electric light, they crowded to their
doom, with the same dreadnought and devoted bravery, up the
slippery slopes of Inkerman.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not long before the roar of the cannon on both sides became
outvoiced almost by the reverberating rattle of musketry, which
was all the more bewildering, as only the very faintest flashes of
flame from the smokeless powder of both sides served to indicate
the exact position of the opposing lines of infantry fire; and it
was only when a new turn of the electric light (which, by-the-bye,
might have changed the course of Egyptian history, had Arabi
enjoyed the advantage of it at Tel-el-Kebir) registered the progress
of the Russian advance, that we could make out the development
of a battle in which unity of command was simply impossible,
and each captain had to be his own general officer. The development
of a modern battle is a very slow process, and this one was
doubly so from the fact, due to the utter darkness in which each
side was occasionally enveloped, that there was much random and
ineffective firing on both parts. But there came a point of time
in the Russian advance when the manipulators of their electric
lights found it impossible to illumine our lines without also
including the Russians within the Asmodean sweep of their rays,
and then it was that our men, seizing their opportunity, plied
their magazine rifles with infernal industry and effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this opportunity did not last long, for suddenly the four
midnight suns of Science, of far more dazzling splendour than the
tourist orbs of the North Cape, which had been rendering possible
the work of slaughter, disappeared from our firmament as completely
as if they had been blazing torches plunged into a pool of
ink; and their disappearance was followed by a brief period of
almost painful silence which overspread the broad and lengthy
field of battle.</p>

<p class='c011'>We never doubted that this pall of pitchy darkness had thus
been suddenly thrown around the battlefield to enable our foes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>make another rush towards us, unimpeded by the accurate aim
of shell and bullet; and a curious thrill, half of pleasure, half of
undefined dread, went shooting through our veins when, as we
were listening intently, peering into the impenetrable darkness
beyond, our ears were struck by a faint peculiar tinkling as if of
jangled metal rods, and the meaning thereof at once became clear
to us. The Russians were fixing bayonets, preparatory to a
charge on our position; and the sound was quickly answered by
the loud and stern command: ‘<em>Aufpflanzen!</em>’ which ran all along
our lines, and was likewise followed by a repetition, on our side,
of the clinking and sharp clicking above alluded to.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely had silence in the ranks been again restored when
another order: ‘Load for magazine-fire!’ rang out in stentorian
tones, and at the same time, almost, the electric lights were
again flashed full upon us, converting darkness into open day, and
showing us the Russians striding swiftly towards us in successive
irregular waves of ever-increasing volume, the nearest to us being
hardly more than a hundred and fifty yards off. On they came
firing all the way, equally regardless of the awful volcanoes of
shrapnel which our batteries belched forth against them and of
the terrific torrent of our small-bore bullets, aimed from behind
the comparative shelter of field-trench parapets, which incessantly
tore through their stolid ranks, mowing them down and massacring
them by thousands. It was impossible for them to preserve
anything like their proper formation under these trying circumstances,
and disorder was spreading rapidly among their irregular
ranks; but the swaying, struggling masses of the grey and green-coated
soldiery of the Czar still came surging stubbornly up the
slope, ever lessening the distance between them and our entrenchments,
till the moment at last seemed come when they should hurl
themselves upon us and try conclusions with the cold steel. And
then, as if by instinct more than pre-concert, the whole surging
masses raised a tremendous shout, and rushed full upon us with
the bayonet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when only about twenty paces in front of us, their onward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>career was suddenly stopped short by some invisible barrier,
which made them crowd upon each other like penned cattle,
passive targets for the bullets of our repeating rifles that rained
upon them thick and fast as hail, knocking them over like so
many rabbits in a ride. This barrier, which thus strangely
stemmed the rush of their storming tide, was composed of fencing
wire of several coils, strongly stretched and impaled, which had
been run along all the front of our entrenched lines as an additional
measure of defence against the contingency of such an
attack, and formed one of the most recent innovations in the
field warfare of the Germans—an innovation which had commended
itself to the Emperor, who himself put it to a practical
and approved test at the autumn manœuvres of last year.</p>

<p class='c011'>A yell of savage fury rose from the storming columns of the
Russians, who had thus been stopped in their career and baulked
of their objective in this most bloody and calamitous manner;
and though the impact of succeeding waves of assailants soon
levelled all the wire fencing with the ground, still the mass
momentum of their charge had been diminished, their dogged
courage had also been shaken by the busy doings of Death
among their huddled ranks during their temporary check; but
worst of all, before the Russians could recover the force of their
forward rush, the Germans were out of their entrenchments and
upon them with the bayonet.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few moments of grim and ghastly hand-to-hand fighting then
ensued—and let it never after this be said that the bayonet has
been entirely supplanted by the bullet; but I had only time to
observe that Gourko’s brave,—I was almost going to say indomitable,—troops
were beginning to waver, to go down, to yield before
the forceful push of the Teutonic pike, when suddenly again the
electric lights of the Russians were turned off, and the dark curtain
of night, in mercy to the vanquished, fell upon the bloody
drama.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pursuit by the Germans in such circumstances was quite impossible,
but, recovering their ranks with singular precision, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>sent salvo after salvo of artillery and musketry in the direction
of the retreating foe, until the ‘Cease firing’ was sounded all
along our victorious line as the faint and startled dawn began to
blush—as if for very shame at such infernal work; and the
bugle-sounds were supplemented by the shrill whistles of the
company commanders, reminding me of the days when I loved
to listen to the clear piping of the darting water-ousel among
the rocky streams of the Grampians, amid scenes unsullied by the
bloody hand of war.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the day broke the results of the nocturnal battle
revealed themselves in all their ghastly horrors; but, beyond
saying that about 10,000 dead and wounded Russians lay in front
of our extended lines, and nearly a third of that number of Germans
in and about our own entrenchments, I will not disgust your
readers with a realistic description of the ghastliness of the battlefield—the
first of its kind, and one which has resulted from an
endeavour to neutralise, or at least minimise, the destructive effects
of the murderous magazine-rifle.</p>

<p class='c011'>This first great victory of ours over the Russians has been
somewhat damped by the news, just received, that our army of
Silesia, which had begun to marshal around Czenstochau preparatory
to a further push forward, has suffered a rather serious
reverse at the hands of the Grand Duke Vladimir, commanding
the 14th and 15th Russian <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps d’Armée</span>, who fell upon Prince
George of Saxony before he had completed his concentration, and
compelled him to fall back.</p>

<p class='c011'>On hearing, however, of Gourko’s crushing defeat by us, and
his retreat towards Warsaw, the Grand Duke Vladimir, like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>victorious Wellington at Quatre-Bras (who desired to effect a junction
with Blücher, on the latter being worsted by the French at
Ligny), resolved to forego the immediate fruits of his triumph and
retire to a point that would enable him to join hands with the
retreating Gourko, and thus give combined battle to the Germans.
This point will probably be Skierniwiçe, the junction-point of the
railway lines from Alexandrovo and Czenstochau to Warsaw,
famous in modern history as the pacific meeting-place of the three
Emperors and their Chancellors several years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>Skierniwiçe, therefore, will probably be the Waterloo of the
Russo-German portion of the campaign, whoever proves its
Wellington; but Skierniwiçe is very much further from Alexandrovo
and Czenstochau than Quatre-Bras and Ligny were from
Mont St. Jean, and some little time, therefore, must necessarily yet
elapse before I shall have it in my power to chronicle the Waterloo
of the present war.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Brussels to-day is rent by conflicting emotions. Frenzied
rage, poignant anxiety, and boiling excitement are struggling not
so much for mastery as for satisfactory expression. The news of
the forthcoming occupation of Antwerp by a British Army Corps
has not been received here with expressions of unmixed satisfaction.
The very fact that the negotiations were kept wholly
secret, with the result that the announcement of so important a
decision first reached us through the public report of the debate in
the House of Commons, has, whether justly or otherwise matters
not, set a vast number of well meaning people by the ears. When
the news reached Brussels yesterday it produced an extravagant
sensation which grew as the night advanced. By tacit consent
people refused to go to bed—clubs and cafés were kept open till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>morning, and all through the principal thoroughfares the noise of
heated discussions might be heard in full blast round the tables
outside the cafés and at every street corner. A large section of
the population, in which ranked many of the better classes, were
greatly incensed against the King’s Government. ‘It is not
astonishing,’ they said, ‘that the measure was kept secret; otherwise
the people would never have permitted so infamous a traffic!’
All the old arguments of 1859 and the half dozen succeeding years
were revived, and in every group of angry disputants the name of
Adelson Castiau continually recurrent, was flung passionately on
the night with every varied accent of which the human voice is
capable. ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il l’a bien dit, Castiau.</span></i> He knew, he foresaw what
must happen, and idiots that we were, we would not listen.’ This
was the prevailing cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be explained that M. Adelson Castiau—who is just
at present given posthumous rank as a hero and patriot—was
an eminent lawyer and ex-deputy, who, from the first, vehemently
opposed the fortification of Antwerp. From the day when in
1859 a committee of twenty-seven officers were appointed to
discuss the subject until the completion of the immense work
some six years later, M. Castiau waged war against the scheme.
He spoke, wrote, organised committees, and headed deputations
protesting against the plan. His argument was that, from a
military point of view, the project involved in principle the
abandonment of the country and a shameful flight by the army
towards the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Polders de l’Escaut</span>,’ where certainly no one would
ever come to molest it, but would be quite content to leave it to
be destroyed by marsh fevers. The fortification of Antwerp, he
said later, meant the destruction of our neutrality. Antwerp offers
to-day, with her forty kilometres of heavily-armed works, her
citadel and her dozen attached forts, a standing invitation to
invasion. It was handing over the country to the first comer, and
building up one of the finest military and commercial positions in
the world, only for the benefit of England, which had coveted it for
over a century.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>And to-day the good people of Brussels, and, I fear of Belgium
generally, are regretfully recalling his words and indorsing
his opinion. Hence the frenzied rage of which I have spoken
leaping flame-like all the length of the Boulevards.</p>

<p>BRITISH TROOPS IN THE PLACE VERTE, ANTWERP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I have just heard that the British Army Corps, under Sir
Evelyn Wood, has reached Antwerp, and that disembarkation is
rapidly going forward. Until the transports with their escort of
cruisers and torpedo boats actually steamed up the river, people
here affected to believe that they would not come. Chatterers in
the clubs boasted loudly that the wind of popular opinion would
drive the English vessels back from the shores of the Scheldt.
The obvious absurdity of this anticipation is but emphasised by
the fact that the worthy Antwerpers have received the invaders, if
not with enthusiasm, at any rate with a demeanour at once friendly
and business-like. Telegrams in the clubs here comment rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>bitterly on the fact, that instead of visiting them with haughty
resentment, the townsfolk are doing a lively trade with the alien
soldiers in light beers and other cheap beverages, which the troops
are freely purchasing beneath the Rubens Statue in the Place
Verte, where they are being rendezvoused before proceeding to
their billets.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fear has now grown into dread certainty that what we have
always expected is about to happen. France intends to invade
Belgium, and we have before us the prospect of another Waterloo.
Why have the German troops delayed? It has been set forth
again and again by strategists that Germany’s most obvious plan
would be to concentrate her Army Corps of the North upon the
Belgian frontier of France, that it would therefore be to her advantage
either to make use of the two railway lines which, from
Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle, run to Luxembourg, Thionville, and
Virton—one by way of Trèves and the other by Verviers—or,
and by this even more important results might be obtained, she
might combine with this movement the seizure of the line of
the Meuse, when, by debouching a part of her forces by Chimay
into the Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse, she would be able to attack in
flank the French forces engaged in preventing the Northern Army
Corps forcing the passage of the Meuse between Dun and Mezières.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was always considered as certain, therefore, that instead of
violating Swiss territory to attack France, Germany would certainly,
immediately on the declaration of war, throw an Army Corps into
Belgium. It was supposed that a German First Army Corps could
be concentrated at Aix-la-Chapelle on the eleventh day of mobilisation,
and that it would be established on the Meuse and on the
Sambre to the south of Namur at latest by the evening of the
fifteenth day—that is to say, twenty-four hours after the Second
German Army Corps had deployed before the position on the
Othain.</p>

<p class='c011'>This has no doubt been Germany’s intention. A huge army is
being concentrated on the Eastern frontier. But France is likely
to forestall the movement, and to reach Namur before her adversary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The extraordinary rapidity of her mobilisation may be said to be
due in great measure to the perfection of her railway system on
the Belgian frontier. She has established between Dunkerque and
Mezières no less than seven lines of railway, of which four are
double lines, which place her in direct and immediate communication
with Belgium. These roads are linked and tapped by a transversal
line that follows the whole length of the frontier as far as
Longwy. Then she has, moreover, on this frontier four huge
entrenched camps capable of serving as manœuvre pivots for her
army, and as supports to her base of operations. These camps are
Dunkerque (with its annexes—Bergues and Gravelines), Lille,
Valenciennes (centre of a system of defence which comprises
Condé, Bouchain, and Le Quesnoy), and Maubeuge. To ensure
the retreat of her army in case of failure, she has created a first
line of defence, formed by Valenciennes, Maubeuge, Landrecies,
Hirson, and Mezières. For her second line she has the town of
Reims, surrounded by forts commanding the valleys of the Aisne
and the Marne, and the iron-bound triangle La Fère, Laon, and
Soissons which defends the valley of the Oise, and with the support
of Peronne, the valley of the Somme.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus encouraged by the rapidity of mobilisation—a rapidity
certainly never anticipated by Germany, and probably a little
unexpected by her own officers—France has decided to attack
Germany by Belgium. The seven natural obstacles in her path are
not in themselves formidable. She has, indeed, to cross the Meuse,
the Lower Rhine, the Teutoburgerwald, the Weser, the Hartz, and
the Elbe. The Teutoburgerwald checked, it is true, the Legions of
Varus, but to-day the great roads pierce it in several broad cuttings,
and it is, moreover, traversed by two railway lines, running from
Hamm to Hanover and Magdeburg. The Hartz also is traversed
by good roads and girdled by two railway lines running to Berlin,
one of which is the line which places the German capital in communication
with Coblentz and Metz. Thus her advance should
unquestionably be more rapid than by the inter-Moselle and the
Rhine. If, moreover, she can make good her footing in Belgium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>before the German army, she will undoubtedly find there better
roads, better cantonments, and far greater resources of every kind
than she would find in Lorraine and Oldenburg and the Palatinate.</p>

<p class='c011'>With this object, we hear that the 1st and 2d French Army
Corps are being concentrated at Maubeuge, the 3d and 10th at
Hirson, the 4th and 9th at Givet, and it is expected that all these
forces will be united in the neighbourhood of Namur in the course
of the next four days—that is to say, sooner by five days than any
military authorities have believed possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The entire interest in this country is, therefore, centred in
Namur, for which place I start at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wildest excitement animates this place. Garrison and
townsfolk alike are filled with generous enthusiasm for the French
cause, a rapid change of feeling which may be attributed in some
degree to the Antwerp episode. The most extravagant rumours
are abroad. Belgian co-operation with the French forces is talked
of openly, and with a grandiloquent disregard of consequences that
would be almost amusing if it were not so grave. It is loudly
proclaimed that Chartreuse and the old citadel of Liége are determined
to resist the German advance, and here at Namur itself the
populace (not the army) declare their intention of holding the
‘Key of Belgium,’ if need be, until their French allies can support
them. As for Namur, its strategical position might well entitle
it to be considered as one of the keys of Belgium. Till lately,
however, the fortifications were in no condition to resist modern
artillery. Thanks, however, to the wisdom of the Belgium Government
in adopting the plans of General Briamont all this has been
changed. Within the year 1892 the fortifications were so far
completed as to furnish means for a strong defence. I give these
rumours merely for what they are worth, and to show the temper
of the populace.</p>

<p class='c011'>As I write this telegram a report reaches me that French
troops have crossed the frontier at Maubeuge and Valenciennes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and it is alleged that the small Belgian garrisons at Mons and
Philippeville, after giving a wildly enthusiastic reception to their
visitors, have valiantly offered their services to General Saussier.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE MEETING OF THE FOUR FLEETS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH IN COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH SQUADRON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We are favoured with another letter from Admiral Colomb, who
has been fortunate enough—in one way—to observe the remarkable
naval transactions in the North Sea:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not knowing what would happen, or quite what to do, I lay at
Colberg, as being a place less likely to be interfered with by the
Russians by way of blockade than some of the other ports, and to
get intelligence of what was going on. It was here I heard of the
violation of the Belgian territories by France. I thought that the
drawing of France into this step was equally an example of
German shrewdness and of French rashness. I was not at all
surprised that we should so suddenly have been brought into it, in
the occupation of Antwerp, which is now being hastened on, and
of course we were bound to mobilise everything we could put our
hands on. I was sure we could never stop at the defence of
Belgium. It seemed equally sure that we could not leave the
Baltic, the Belts, and the Sound in the hands of the French and
the Russians, for that would almost certainly sacrifice Germany.
I had seen her hesitate to attack the Russian Fleet alone, and
I was sure that against Russia and France together, she could
only shut her main fleets up in her ports as she did in 1870
though she is so much more powerful now than she was then.
There was a small German cruiser at Colberg; she trusted to get
into shoal water if a superior Russian found her out—and her
captain told me that he believed the German Government thought
as I did in reference to the policy of attacking the Russian fleet;
but that, beside this, they were alarmed at the crowds of small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>vessels with heavy guns, which, it was assumed, might be associated
in any naval action in Russian waters. I only say this as I am
told it,—I don’t know anything of the real facts.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I thought the appointment of the Duke of Edinburgh to the
command in chief of the North Sea Fleet was a very natural one.
His reputation as a tactician, I had always heard, was first-rate,
and naval officers always seemed ready to depend on and follow
him. I was told the command had been offered to Sir Geoffrey
Hornby, but that his medical advisers absolutely forbid his accepting
it; however, he seems to have had a good hand in the programme.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The German officers entirely calculated on France making such
an attack on their Baltic shores as she had proposed to make in
1870. The German papers rather made light of it, and hammered
away on the two points that France would find it difficult to get
transport and appliances, as Cherbourg and Brest were really her
nearest ports; and that England would step in and prevent a
descent if it got as far as that. But the Germans were everywhere
full of preparation on land, and troops were concentrating at
Colberg and elsewhere. I had read in one of our papers last year
that for a long time the bulk of the French Fleet had been kept at
Toulon, and so I was not surprised to see it stated in an English
paper that only five battle-ships had left Brest for the North Sea,
with, however, a good proportion of cruisers and small craft. If,
then, this were really so, it would follow that, supposing the
Germans had been able to bring forward any more ships in the
time, and had repaired the <em>Oldenburg</em>, they must be either <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à cheval</span></i>
between the French and Russian Fleets—able to strike at each
before the other could assist—or else between two fires; according
to how they looked at it. I had seen them retire before the
Russian Fleet on the apprehension of a French approach. Would
they now, with more complete knowledge of the forces against
them, reverse their policy and strike at either? Or would they
remain quiescent; shut themselves up in Wilhelmshaven, and trust
to their land defences to repel all attacks? There seemed almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>an even chance, and I made up my mind to go on to Kiel, and to
the Jahde, if I made out nothing at the first-named port.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I had hoped to have made Kiel in daylight, but the wind failing
me, it was dark when I got off the port. I could only guess where
I was, for the Bülk Light did not show, and all I could make out
in the way of lights seemed to be about the works of Friedrichsort,
though the regular light there was also extinguished; thereupon I
lay-to. I had the usual side-lights burning, and I suppose they
were seen, for we had not been there ten minutes lying-to when a
ship without lights of any sort came out of the gloom, and a voice
hailed us in an unknown tongue first, and receiving no response,
then in French, asking what we were. I answered, and presently
a boat with a Russian officer boarded us. He was very polite;
told us there were no German warships in Kiel except some small
craft; that a squadron of Russian cruisers was blockading the
place; and that I must get out of it. So there it was, and all I
could do was to make sail for the Sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Off the Jahde we found quite a strong combined French and
Russian Fleet. We counted seven large French ships and six large
Russians, so that it was clear that the Germans had made no
attempt to interfere with the junction. There were many smaller
vessels, chiefly French, and the whole fleet, except some small
vessels, was at anchor.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We made for the vicinity of a French flagship, and were soon
boarded by a boat from another ship with some sort of flag up.
The officer warned us that the Jahde was blockaded, and that
though, on our promise not to try to slip in, we might remain with
the fleets, we should assuredly be captured or sunk if we tried to
break blockade. As we only wanted to see what was going on, I
readily gave a promise, and then we learnt that the Russian ships
had only joined the French a few hours before we came in sight,
and that no one knew what was going to be done, but it was
ordered that the whole fleet must weigh before dark. The officer
told us they expected transports and troops daily, but that he did
not know what was intended.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>‘Immediately after dark; accordingly, the whole combined fleet
got under weigh. Lights were shown during the process, but then
all were extinguished and the ships disappeared without our having
the least idea which direction they had taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We were astonished soon after daylight next morning to see
not only our friends the Russians and French steaming slowly in
from the northward, but to see an apparently still greater fleet in
the haze to the westward.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There was an evident check and hesitation in the Franco-Russian
Fleet, and presently we well understood why, when we
distinctly made out the English white ensign flying in the Western
Fleet. Our ships came on quite slowly. We could make out that
they were grouped in three great masses. I counted fifteen in the
most advanced portion, all very large ships, and I soon made out
that they were in three lines, with a flagship at the head of each.
Soon I made out the middle one to be certainly the <em>Alexandra</em>
with an Admiral’s flag at the main. On her right I supposed was
the <em>Camperdown</em>, with Vice-Admiral Seymour’s flag; and on the
left the <em>Anson</em>, with that of Rear-Admiral Adeane. I had seen
them both before I left England, and supposed they retained their
commands. There were several small vessels near this great mass
of ships, and then to the right of them was a group of seven large
ships, three of them as if partly rigged, and four of them like
turret-ships. Then, again, on the left of the main fleet I could
make out what seemed to be a cluster of smaller vessels.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘We had barely made out all this, when out of the cloud of mist
overhanging the mouth of the Jahde there came clearly the body
of the German Fleet—ten of them I counted.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Never was such an exciting time as this. It seemed to me
that I was about to witness the greatest sea-battle that the world
had ever seen, and when I noticed the Franco-Russian Fleet
separating its bigger from its smaller ships, and drawing the latter
into one long line, facing west, and stretching north and south, I
made certain they were going to run right at the English Fleet
pell-mell, in the way I had always read about.’</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>RETREAT OF FRENCH CRUISERS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>SINKING OF THE ‘ELAINE.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But yet I had not heard of any declaration of war by England,
and it seemed a terribly reckless thing for the French and
Russians—of whom I could only count fourteen in the line they
had drawn out, to run down upon what seemed to be twenty-two
English ironclads, when they could be joined, in a couple of hours
perhaps, by the ten Germans. The three fleets were each about
ten miles from my yacht, and I was in the middle part. There
was not much wind, and what there was being from the southward,
left smooth water, but brought down a good deal of mist
from the flat land of which one could only get indications by
buildings and trees sticking up above the horizon. I could not
help thinking how wise the Germans were to have their fleet here
rather than at Kiel. Nature sheltered them from attack at
Wilhelmshaven in a way that no sort of art could do at Kiel, and
here they were quite safe behind their shoals, and yet ready to
fall upon their enemies at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, they were hemmed in fast enough. That was
made plain by the fact that at least five small French cruisers
had turned up at daylight a long way inshore of where I was,
and had evidently been there all night keeping watch on the
port. While I was weighing, these cruisers, some of which seemed
much nearer to our own fleet, appeared to be coming out—I supposed
in obedience to signal—and then I saw that several German
ships were evidently coming out after them, and steaming at
speed. I had hardly realised the state of affairs when I saw I
was in for a hot skirmish, and that we should be in the middle
of it ourselves. However, we put on full speed, and steamed as
hard as we could, straight for the <em>Alexandra</em>. Some of the French
now passed us in retreat, firing their stern guns; and presently we
were passing between an advancing and retiring line, and were
between two fires. My wife gripped my arm tight and stood and
looked, but never a word she said. Nor I either, for I had a horror
of what might happen, and was powerless.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>SINKING OF THE YACHT ‘ELAINE.’</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>‘What’s that?’ cried my wife presently, pointing to the sky
over the German ships. What, indeed? I was only conscious
that some monstrous, roaring, and very relentless thing had passed
me, and made a crash somewhere, and that my steward had torn
up the hatchway, crying, ‘Good God! the bottom’s out of the
ship!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Then I knew that a German projectile had passed through
our deck and planking below, and that we were sinking. I holloaed
down to the engineer, ‘Keep her going as long as you
can!’ dashed down for my wife’s jewel-box, collared it, and was
up again to find the men clearing away the boat. I knew the
engine-room compartment was by way of being water-tight, and
that we had a little time to spare in consequence; but I wanted
to run out of the fire, which I could not do in the overcrowded
boat. My engineer was as cool and white as marble. ‘She’ll
go a bit yet, sir!’ he called up through the skylight; ‘the
water’s leakin’ in through them sluices pretty, but there ain’t
more nor six inches yet.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The boat was down, towing alongside, and I gave the word to
quit the yacht as she was sinking markedly by the stern. The
engineer came regretfully last into the boat before myself. ‘Them
blooming engines ’ll go a bit yet,’ he muttered as he passed me.
‘I’m glad it worn’t a Rooshian shot anyhow.’ It was no use
sticking to the yacht, but she had done us the good turn of carrying
us out of the line of fire, which, indeed, was slackening by
reason of the approach of the French to their own fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole thing was such a scurry that one hardly knew
what had, and what had not happened, but we understood it when
my poor <em>Elaine</em>, with a great snort and splash, suddenly threw
her nose into the air and went down stern first, leaving us in
the overcrowded boat, clear now of the cross fire which had,
indeed, nearly ceased. Then I became aware of two things;
one, that a heavy English cruiser, with a flag of truce flying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>was steaming towards the Franco-Russian Fleet; and next, that a
smaller ship was steering direct for my boat. In a very few
moments we found ourselves safe on board the <em>Blonde</em>, kindly
welcomed and commiserated by Commander Pretyman, who told
us he had been signalled to pick us up and take us to the
flagship.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON BOARD THE FLAGSHIP.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>ACCEPTANCE OF THE ENGLISH TERMS BY THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH ADMIRALS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The change was sudden and unexpected enough when we
found ourselves greeted by the Duke the moment we put foot
on board the <em>Alexandra</em>. My old friend Keppel had, we found,
already turned out of his cabin to make room for my wife;
and the Duke led us—still rather dazed—into his after-cabin,
assuring us that we were his welcome guests till he could send
us home. I could not help wondering at the moment at the quietness
of his manner and his exceeding urbanity on the brink of
such tremendous occurrences and with such awful responsibilities
on his shoulders. I found I was by no means alone in my admiration
of this amiable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aplomb</span></i>, but I soon learnt that not only the
Duke, but most of the officers did not apprehend a collision.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the situation was that war with France had not yet been formally
decreed, and that the flag of truce had gone with the Duke’s
Flag Captain, Brooke, to ‘invite’ the French to withdraw their
forces, in which case no attack would be made, and the Russians
might retire unmolested to Cronstadt. If, however, in three hours
the Russian Squadron had not separated from the French, and
the French had not signified their acquiescence, the united English
and German Fleets together would enforce compliance. The
Duke’s secretary, Mr. Rickard, showed me the copy of the message.
It was exceedingly firm, but exceedingly conciliatory; praying the
French Admiral Planché and the Russian Shestakov to reflect that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>in presence of forces so enormously superior, their honour could in
no way be touched, and that common dictates of humanity forbade
the awful effusion of blood which would be so uselessly shed in the
event of a refusal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ships were all prepared for action,—those with masts
appearing to be nearly stripped,—and now I saw that the German
Fleet was well out, and steaming directly for us. The
officers all seemed a good deal more excited than the Admiral, but
still I found that no one believed in the possibility of resistance.
The latest news by a despatch vessel represented that the embarkation
of troops at Cherbourg, which was closely watched by
several of our cruisers, had apparently been stopped, and this, it
was felt, gave additional cause to believe in a peaceable solution,
as it was made clear that even if the English Fleet only stopped
the transports, the whole Franco-Russian game was up. A last
telegram from Paris, <em>viâ</em> Madrid, expressed belief that the French
Admiral Prémesnil had sailed with orders to return to Brest if the
English appeared in observation off the Jahde in greatly superior
force.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding, there was not a glass in the ships that was
not persistently directed upon the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Immortalité</span></i>—now about ten
miles off, and stopped close to the French Flagship—and her great
white flag, for it had been arranged that she should hoist the
Dutch ensign under it as the signal that the terms were rejected.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hours drew on, and for perhaps two there was no sign.
The distance was too great to make out ordinary flag signals,
but sometimes it could be seen that such were hoisted, and one
of the signal midshipmen created a fresh stir by affirming that
the ships in view were ‘stoking up.’</p>

<p class='c011'>My heart was in my mouth with the excitement of the
moment, but if I was as cool and unconcerned in outward appearance
as the officers and men surrounding me, I must have
wonderfully belied my real feelings. Suddenly the head signalman
called out in a hurried voice, not taking his eye from his
glass: ‘The Russians are moving, sir!’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>We could not in fact distinguish French from Russians at the
distance, but I had told them that the Russians were on the right
wing, and as they looked, they could see the right wing opening
out from the left. A sort of disappointed sigh passed round the
group, as by a single impulse they dropped their glasses and
looked at one another. I am sure I saw an impatient gesture
of the Duke’s right arm, and a certain setting of his lips which
confirmed it. There was no Dutch ensign. Common sense had
overcome the sentiment of the allies; the terms were accepted,
and the Russians were off to the Gulf of Finland.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this surmise was confirmed when Captain Brooke returned
on board; but I never saw complete disappointment so unmistakably
betrayed as it was on his face, that of the Admiral and the
other officers who received him at the gangway.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have little more to say. The French Fleet presently passed
us, steering to the westward. The Duke detached twelve of his
battle-ships under Sir Michael Seymour with seven or eight
cruisers—all newest types of ships—to follow up the Russians
into their own waters, while he himself followed up the French
with the remainder of his fleet. My wife and I were sent on board
the <em>Thames</em> which came home full speed with the news.</p>

<p class='c011'>I remain in a kind of mental paralysis. No one had ever suggested
to me that in the presence of British power, naval war was
to become but naval peace. All the naval people whom I had
ever heard talk about it always seemed to have in their minds a
certainty that in naval war, no two hostile fleets could ever see
one another without rushing to a mutual destruction pell-mell.
And yet I could get away from the fact that to every Frenchman
and every Russian in the combined fleet I had seen, it must have
been clear that no one but a madman could have pursued any other
course than that which their Admirals followed. Of course it
might have been different had war been actually declared.</p>

<p class='c011'>I owe the opportunity afforded me for writing to you from
this wretched place to an accident which has befallen my best
horse, and will delay me possibly for another couple of days.
The mischance is doubly unfortunate at this moment, inasmuch
as reports from our front lead to the supposition that an important
engagement is at hand. Any adequate analysis of the rumours
that reach me constantly, contradictory as they are, continually
varied, chequered with additions and omissions, and burdened
with the extravagant local interest environing some wholly trivial
circumstance, would be as entirely out of the question for me as
for any of your readers at home. Indeed, your readers are certainly
infinitely better informed than I am as to current events.</p>

<p class='c011'>When I left Trebizonde, five days ago, the town was in a state
of fevered anxiety, of enthusiastic anticipation, tempered in some
sober quarters by a quiet but not ungenerous scepticism born of
previous experience. The English were coming, cried the enthusiasts.
Three English Army Corps (Heaven alone knows
whence it was proposed to get them) were on their way to Trebizonde,
to Samsoun, and to Shumla to aid their Turkish and
Italian allies. The eastern division of the Mediterranean Fleet
had already entered the Black Sea, as much to the surprise (and
perhaps, somewhat to the chagrin) of the Turkish commanders at
the Dardanelles and the Kavaks as of the generals of Russia and
of France. In Trebizonde and the surrounding villages a certain
basis of probability was built beneath these rumours by the fact
that English agents had, for a week, been purchasing mules, sheep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>and cattle, at, as is usual with British agents in times of stress,
some five times their market value to any other purchaser. Nor
have the native producers profited more than usual by this large-handed
generosity, for some two or three Greek and Armenian
traders, anticipating, as is their wont, honest English procrastination,
have been beforehand with the army agents, with whom they
are now dealing at altogether fancy prices. This, however, is
after all but a small matter beside the great question of our
intervention. That England’s action should invariably be delayed
almost (but never quite) until too late—that her transports should
reach their destination empty, her troops be either unprovided
with cartridges, or supplied with those of some obsolete and useless
pattern—that by every mistake ineptitude can secure or
official ignorance produce, all arrangements connected with the
disembarkation and provisioning, and general welfare of whatever
forces have been tardily despatched, must inevitably break down
but for the tireless energy, the unfailing resource, the unremitting
good temper and never-flagging loyalty of all the officers and men
thus maltreated, are matters which have long since come to be as
well known abroad as they are beginning to be recognised at home.
‘The English,’ said the good people of Trebizonde, while awaiting
the expected Army Corps, ‘are good but careless. They are richer
than the Russians, and they are less corrupt, but they are also
more stupid.’ This, as the independent criticism of allies, more
than anxious to be generous, is worth at least a second thought.</p>

<p>BRITISH TROOPS LANDING AT TREBIZONDE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>I would gladly have witnessed the disembarkation of our
troops (for aught I know it may have already taken place), but,
after fruitlessly waiting many days in dreary Trebizonde, I no
longer dared to delay. News had come that a large Russian force
was advancing from Kars westward towards Erzeroum, and,
although there are in and around that place some 50,000 Turkish
troops, yet, save at Keupru Kui, a place about nine hours’ ride
from Erzeroum on the Kars road, little or no preparation appears
to have been made to resist an enemy. Erzeroum, let it be
remembered, is entered by three posterns, called respectively the
Stamboul, the Ardahan, and the Kars gates. The roads from
them lead to Ardahan, Kars, Van, Erzinghan, and Trebizonde.
On the south of Erzeroum, at a very short distance from the walls,
a mountain descends steeply towards the city, which it altogether
commands, and a direct road runs from Van to Moush, and from
that town to the mountain, from which two water channels lead
into Erzeroum. If an enemy once had possession of the eminence—and,
so far as I can learn, there is little or nothing to prevent
him—he would be able to turn these water-courses off from the
city. There are, it is true, a few wells within the walls, but the
supply from them is already insufficient for the requirements of
the population, without taking into account the troops quartered
in and around the town. It seems typical of Turkish apathy that
so little should have been done to secure this their last great
stronghold in Asia Minor from attack. I am going, of course,
merely by what I hear from Turkish officers, as I have as yet been
unable to see for myself; but I have hitherto had no reason to
discredit their information.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>It appears that from time to time, since 1878, proposals
have been made for fortifying various strong natural positions,
but that, with a procrastinatory belief in the protection of
Providence that is wholly Turkish and almost English, these
plans have been continually set aside until it is now too late
to execute them. Thus on the Van Road, about five miles
from Erzeroum, there is an admirable position known as the
Palandukain defile. This position was protected after a fashion
in 1876, when a fort was constructed capable of offering sturdy
resistance. Another fort had been built also at that time at
Gereguzek, eighteen miles from Erzeroum, on the Ardahan road.
Another position, that of the Devé Boinou Bogaz, five miles from
Erzeroum, on the Kars road, was considered at that time to be a
good place for a fort, and yet further defences were then constructed
at the Loghana defile, which is some twenty-four hours
from Erzeroum, on the Kars road. There are, no doubt, also
important positions on the Bayazid road, as, for instance, at Deli
Baba—a narrow gorge through high mountains, which the Turks
declare to be impregnable—at Taher Gedi, five hours’ march
further on, and at Kara Kilissa, beyond which there is a level
road to Bayazid. Since the war, however, it appears that little or
nothing has been done to strengthen or even to maintain these
positions in an adequate state of defence. There has been much
talk of late in Constantinople of extensive armaments on this
frontier. Krupp guns have, it has been said, been sent to supplement
the bronze cannon manufactured at Tophané, with which
the forts of Erzeroum were in the last war mainly armed. As to
whether any such material has reached its destination I am as yet
uninformed. People on this road, which it must surely have
traversed, profess to know nothing of it. It is to be feared that
we may expect a repetition of the famous story of the million liras
expenditure said to have been incurred in the fortification of
Erzeroum in the last war.</p>

<p class='c011'>I did not journey from Trebizonde alone, but took advantage
of the departure of a huge straggling convoy of mules and pack-horses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>laden with ammunition for Erzeroum. There were also
with us half a dozen English doctors who have taken service with
the Porte, and have volunteered to attend the wounded under fire.
Owing to the accident to my horse, who slipped, poor brute,
through a ragged hole in the wide stone bridge across the Kara
Su, close to this place (a terrible pitfall for artillery), and badly
scraped both his own shin and his master’s, these gentlemen have
perforce abandoned me until such time as I can obtain another
beast.</p>

<p class='c011'>The traffic through this little place, which is the point of
junction of the Trebizonde and Erzinghan roads to Erzeroum, and
as a rule at this season is almost deserted, is in itself indicative of
stirring events in our front. All through the day there has been
a continuous passage of nondescript wayfarers in either direction.
Turkish soldiers—stragglers or deserters may be—some sick, some
slightly wounded; Koordish Bashi-bazouks, pure bandits for the
most part, flashing great arsenals of gleaming weapons in their
waist-belts, and armed, many of them, with Winchester rifles,
remnants of the last war; slim, evil-visaged Circassians on lean,
wiry horses, and gaunt Zaibeks, ferocious beneath their extravagant
headgear, have tramped and clattered continuously past the
miserable khan where I am established. Some of these gentry, I
note, have Russian great-coats with regimental numbers on the
shoulder strap, flung either across their cruppers, or around their
shoulders. This is a sure indication that there has at least been
some skirmish or reconnaissance in which Russian arms have
suffered not a little.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>I am profiting by an opportunity to send you a hurried message
by a Turkish officer on his way to Erzeroum with despatches.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Soon after writing last to you, I managed to pick up a horse—a
poor beast enough truly, in place of my stalwart grey—and
pushed on to Erzeroum. There I found all in confusion. Certain
news had arrived of a Russian advance in force along the Kars
road, and every available man had been thrown forward to meet
it. It was but natural that the Russians should seize the earliest
possible opportunity of hurling themselves against the Turkish
stronghold, which they might very reasonably expect to find
unprepared to receive them. More or less unprepared the Turks
indeed were, but Ghazi Moukhtar Pasha—the hero of ’77—who
had himself reached Erzeroum but a few days since, was fully
determined not to permit his traditional enemy to win an easy
triumph. As I have said, every available regiment was ordered
to meet the attack, and hurried forward to Keupru Keui, where
the stand was to be made. I have as yet no details—indeed, as I
stayed but an hour or so in Erzeroum to feed my horses, I have
hitherto been able to see no one in authority; but so far as I can
gather, the Turks, though outnumbered, were not greatly inferior
to their adversaries, over whom they had the additional enormous
advantage of being in a position which tradition has taught them
to regard as well-nigh impregnable. In any case Turkish arms
seem to have gained a signal victory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very soon after leaving Erzeroum, which I did shortly before
mid-day this morning, I began to meet with unmistakable evidences
that a big battle had either been fought or was in progress. First a
knot of some twenty infantrymen, weary, haggard, and ragged, met
me on the steep slope of the hill some five miles beyond the town.
They were all jaded beyond expression—every one was wounded
more or less grievously—several were using their rifles as crutches,
and some who had lost or abandoned their rifles were helping themselves
along either by the aid of their comrades’ shoulders, or by
stakes, or waggon-boards, or rammers, or indeed any of the miscellaneous
articles of wood or metal that are to be found strewn
along the line of a straggling fight. I gave them a water-skin,
and offered a bottle of brandy (as <em>ilitch</em>—medicine for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>wounds). The water they took, but none would touch the spirit
save one gaunt, white-moustached veteran, who mumbled incoherencies
about Algeria, by way seemingly of excuse. While
they drank I asked them what was doing. ‘A great battle was
being fought,’ they said, but their opinions were divided as to the
course of the action; several men (weak from loss of blood)
opined that the enemy was too strong for them. But one broad-shouldered,
bright-eyed little fellow, who had had all the flesh of
one cheek torn from him by a shell splinter, and had bound the
wound with a strip from his rough serge jacket, was loud in his
derision of this view. ‘It was Eski Zagra again,’ he said. The
Moskoffs were driven back, beaten hopelessly, and pursued by agile
Bashi-bazouks through the slippery passes, the precipitous fastnesses,
the treacherous paths of the rugged route, a pursuit without
cess or quarter—where every enemy, whether wounded or not,
was exultingly slaughtered as soon as caught. The little veteran
illustrated with horribly realistic gestures his own views as to the
treatment of Russian wounded. With a foul gusto that raised
wild enthusiasm in his weary comrades, he demonstrated how he
would hew off the noses and lips of his enemy; how he would
gouge out their eyes with his bayonet before he plunged it into
their throats and twisted it till the victims died suffocated with
their own blood. He outlined other horrors, but I had had
enough, and left him posing in anticipation as a hero among his
fellows, while I rode on towards this place.</p>

<p class='c011'>That this fierce implacable Moslem had been right in his conjecture
I soon had ample—ay, terrible—proof. In every mile,
even on the rugged track itself, as I neared the spot from which I
write, the horrible evidences of deadly carnage multiplied and
repeated themselves. Disembowelled horses, broken limbers,
little mounds of dead, fallen one on another, their still, calm,
white faces in cruel contrast to the extravagant distortion of their
scattered and twisted limbs; and everywhere traces of that ruthless
hatred vowed by the Turk to his hereditary enemy. Hideous
featureless corpses stared at me out of eyeless sockets from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>roadside, their hands uplifted and bloody, showing that wounded,
not dead Russians, had been thus maltreated; occasionally a
movement, slight though perceptible, caused me to dismount,
eager to aid some mutilated sufferer, but all to no purpose—the
Turks had done their work too well. As I advanced, the spectacle
of these recurrent horrors increased in its revelations of barbarism
and malignant cruelty. The number of Turkish dead diminished
step by step, as that of the Russians augmented, and by the time
I reached this place I had had such a surfeit of ghoul-feasting
(for the eye) as I envy no man.</p>

<p class='c011'>While talking to Salem Bey Agris—the gentleman to whose
good offices I am indebted for the conveyance of this hurried
despatch, at least, as far as Erzeroum—a poor horse hobbled up,
browsing its way along the thin coarse grass which covers the
bank on which I was seated. Something in the animal’s movements
attracting my attention, I looked up and noticed to my
infinite horror that the poor brute, which was still saddled and
bridled, had but three legs—the off fore leg being from the
shoulder downwards nothing but a sliver<a id='t109'></a> of white bone splintered
to a pencil point. Horror-struck, I seized my revolver—my first
thought being to put the poor creature out of its pain. But as it
browsed on placidly, seemingly indifferent, I called Salem Bey’s
attention to its condition. ‘Poor horse,’ he said (and note that
he had surveyed mutilated Russians with placid indifference), ‘a
suffering animal, indeed, tears the breast, but I have seen, only
two hours since, a sight far more heartrending than this. I was
charging with my squadron a troop of Cossacks. It chanced
that a shell burst right over the first line, and, killing two troopers,
tore away the whole muzzle of one of their horses. All was
destroyed in the poor beast, right up to the eyes, and you might
have supposed it would fall dead at once. Nothing of the kind.
It held its place in the ranks, spouting torrents of blood and foam
from its ghastly shattered head, until, fortunately, some stray
Russian bullet laid it low. Until then, I will own,’ he added, ‘I
was afraid for my men.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The Bey, leaving me to digest this tale, strode away in the
dusk to get his horse. ‘Where is your army?’ I have shouted to
him, and his reply is: ‘<em>Bilémem</em> (I do not know). <span class='sc'>Inshallah</span>, it
has gone to <span class='sc'>Kars</span>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Strange is the irony of events. In the month of September
1884, this was the friendly meeting-place of the Emperors of
Russia, Germany, and Austria, who were accompanied by their
respective Chancellors—Bismarck, Kalnoky, and Giers; and now
the chateau where they so ostentatiously feasted, embraced, and
exchanged their pledges of peace, is a heap of smoking ruins.
After this, who shall say that there is any stability in human
affairs, or any trustworthiness in human foresight?</p>

<p class='c011'>The united Russian forces, consisting of the 5th and 6th Corps
under General Gourko, and the 14th and 15th Corps under the
Grand Duke Vladimir, have to-day suffered a crushing defeat at
the hands of the combined German armies of the Vistula and
Silesia, commanded by the King of Saxony, and are now in full
retreat on Warsaw. As I predicted in my last despatch, this has
been the Waterloo of the Russo-German portion of the campaign,
and it has been brilliantly won by the Germans—thanks mainly
to the disconcerting effects of smokeless powder on the tactics of
an enemy who fights better in the mass than in detail, no less
than to the fact of the Russians having committed the radical
error of provoking a war before they were completely equipped
with the new magazine rifle, which, even with the aid of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>French factories that received orders for half a million of the new
weapon, will not be served out to the entire army of the Czar
before the summer of 1894.</p>

<p class='c011'>In my last despatch I recorded how the Grand Duke Vladimir,
in spite of his victory over the German Army of Silesia at Czenstochau,
had refrained from following up his success in consideration
of Gourko’s repulse at Alexandrovo, preferring—like
Wellington, who had similarly beaten Ney at Quatre Bras, but
was yet desirous of succouring the retreating Blücher, who had
come to grief in front of Napoleon on the same day at Ligny—to
retire towards Warsaw for the purpose of joining hands with his
fellow-commander, on the latter being worsted by the King of
Saxony. The distances, of course, were infinitely greater in the present
case; but otherwise the principles of strategy were the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>A glance at the map will show that the junction-point for
Gourko and the Grand Duke Vladimir could only have been
Skierniwiçe, where the railways from Alexandrovo and Czenstochau
converge; and it appears that, though the Grand Duke’s
line of retreat to the common rendezvous was considerably the
longer of the two, nevertheless the bulk of his forces had reached
it first, by reason of the fact that he enjoyed a double line of rails,
whereas Gourko had to move as best he could along a single track.</p>

<p class='c011'>The German Army of the Vistula, with which I had thrown
in my lot as a witness of the war, was not slow to gather itself
together after the battle of Alexandrovo, and start in pursuit of
Gourko’s shattered forces, but much precious time was lost by us
in repairing bridges which our retreating foes had blown up; and
though at last, by dint of great exertions on our part, the railway
proved not altogether unavailable to us for transport purposes,
still the earlier stages of our advance on Warsaw simply assumed
the form of an ordinary march along, and parallel with, the line,
the engineers pontooning or planking any bridgeless stream or
ravine which obstructed our progress.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Vlokavek, which our advanced guard reached on the fifth
day after the battle of Alexandrovo, though the distance is only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>about thirty miles, we were considerably hampered, and even hurt,
by the flanking fire of a Russian battery, which had established
itself in a safe position on the right bank of the Vistula—a
battery, strange to say, which was unsupported by any body of
infantry of which we could discover trace; and the King of
Saxony, who, in spite of his sixty-four summers, is still almost as
vigorous and alert as when he commanded on the Meuse, determined
to imitate, though, of course, on a very much smaller scale,
the celebrated passage of the Douro by Wellington (of which, by
the way, this was, curiously enough, the anniversary, the 12th
May). Accordingly, the 3d battalion of the ‘Old Dessauers’
Magdeburg regiment, under Major von Wusterhausen, was
stealthily ferried over the Vistula, which is here both broad and
deep, at the dead of night; and, performing a silent and circuitous
march to the rear of the Russian battery, it opened a heavy fire
on the bewildered Muscovites, just as the latter, profiting by the
breaking dawn, were about to begin their usual day’s work of
pounding away at our advancing columns; and, charging with a
cheer up to the emplacements, before the pieces could be reversed,
the ‘Old Dessauers’ killed or captured every one of the gunners.
For this smart and effective feat of arms Major von Wusterhausen
will doubtless receive the Iron Cross of the first class and the
rank of colonel.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the main incident which marked the course of our
advance, though I might fill columns by recounting the minor
vicissitudes of our march, especially the intolerable botheration
which was occasioned us by the clouds of Cossacks and Dragoons—the
latter little more than mere mounted infantry—who pertinaciously
hovered on our flanks in search of fitting opportunities
for harassing us, and had ever and anon to be brushed away like
so many troublesome swarms of mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime the telegraph had kept us duly informed of
the various stages in the forward movement of the army of Silesia
along the other and longer side of the triangle, of which Skierniwiçe
is the apex, and it was naturally enough our endeavour so to time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>our junction with it as to render it impossible for the Russians to
attack our two armies severally and beat them in detail, even if
they should have the stomach to assume the offensive, which we
gravely doubted.</p>

<p class='c011'>When our headquarters had reached Lowitz, which is only
about fourteen miles from Skierniwiçe, and established itself in
a pretty chateau, Arcadia by name, belonging to the Radziwill
family, an officer of the Empress Frederick’s Posen Hussars
(Death’s Heads), who had made a long and venturesome ride
across country from Lipce, came spurring in with a despatch from
Prince George of Saxony, announcing that the combined Russian
forces under Gourko and the Grand Duke Vladimir had taken
up a strong defensive position behind the Lupta brook (which runs
into the Bzura, an affluent of the Vistula), with their left resting
on a village, Stryzboga, and their right on another hamlet,
Dromiloff, their centre being Skierniwiçe. The left half of their
line, defended by the troops of the Czar’s eldest brother, was formed
by the Lupta itself, a brook about the size of the Bistritz at
Sadowa; while the right half was thrown back from this streamlet
at an angle of about twenty-five degrees, so as to profit by some
ridgy ground in its rear. Prince George of Saxony, therefore,
invited his royal brother to attack General Gourko with all energy
on the morrow, while he himself would simultaneously assail the
position of the Grand Duke Vladimir, a proposal which King
Albert, after brief consultation with his Staff, declared his readiness
to act upon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, two hours before dawn, all our troops were under
arms, and in motion for the various positions which had been
assigned them. On our half of the Russian front the 3d
(Brandenburg) Corps, with the 7th Division, advanced to open the
attack, while the 8th Division acted as reserve, and our two
Cavalry Divisions were directed to keep a look-out on our left
flank, adapting their action to the nature of the ground and the
development of the infantry portion of the fight. Between us and
the enemy the terrain was pretty wavy with occasional patches of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>crops and cover, while in front of Skierniwiçe it rose into a gentle
slope, on the top of which spread the extensive wood forming the
deer park and game preserves of the castle (famous for its Three
Emperors’ Meeting), of which the turrets were just visible above
the tree-tops. This, as I said, formed the centre of the Russian
position; and it was by opening our guns in this direction that
we began the battle, with the view of making the enemy believe
that our main objective was the middle of their line.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a couple of hours or so the fight was nothing but an
artillery duel at long range, and it was plain that although the
Russian artillery was more advantageously posted, it had the
utmost difficulty in finding the range, and even the exact position
of our guns, owing to the comparative smokelessness of their
discharges. On the other hand, after the Russian outposts had
been driven in, the Jäger Battalion of the 3d Corps, which,
courting every dip in the ground, had stealthily crept forward for
some considerable distance in a hollow beyond our batteries, and
lined the edge of a rye-field, within about 3000 metres of the
Russian guns, opened fire at this very long range, and not without
fatal effects; for with a good glass we could see the Russian
artillerists dropping beside their pieces, a fact which made us
realise the truth of the German Emperor’s remark that, if field
guns are to hold their ground as weapons of modern warfare, their
range must still be further increased beyond that of the newest
form of small bore rifle.</p>

<p class='c011'>To emphasise the impression produced by this combined
artillery and musketry fire—of such a galling and invisible kind—we
made a show of manœuvring large bodies of infantry over
against the Russian centre, as if in preparation for an attack in
force; and presently we could discern that this feint movement on
our part was responded to by the pushing up of more of the
enemy’s force from either flank into the woods of Skierniwiçe,
for the purpose of giving us a reception lacking nothing in warmth
should we have the temerity to essay an entrance there.</p>

<p class='c011'>While this renewed concentration in the Russian centre was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>going on, a curious incident happened, which puzzled us not a
little at first. This was the sudden emerging from the wood of
what appeared in the distance to be several squadrons of cavalry,
which headed straight for our lines, and came careering down right
on the rye-field where the Jäger Battalion before-mentioned, from
its concealed position, was playing such sore havoc among the
Russian gunners with their long range and invisible fire, and we
doubted not that their whereabouts had at last been discovered.
Accordingly, while our guns loaded with shrapnel, word was
passed to the Stendal Hussars, who, acting as cavalry of the 7th
Division, were standing ensconced in a hollow on the rear flank of
our batteries, to prepare for hurling themselves upon these presumptuous
horsemen. But this counter attack proved to be
unnecessary; for presently we could discern that the Russian
steeds were riderless, and, on coming nearer, they turned out to be
only a huge herd of very fine deer, which had been scared out of
their leafy haunts in the forest of Skierniwiçe by the infernal
pother going on there. It may be remembered that, in his
narrative of the battle of Königgrätz, the late Count Moltke
referred to a similar incident.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, our real object, which was the delivery of our
main attack on the right flank of the Russians, was being successfully
attained. It can scarcely be expected that I, or any other
single eye-witness, should be able to detail the incidents and
development of a battle which extended along a line of more than
six miles, as the reasons which preclude a General from exercising
anything like unity of command over so vast an area form an
equal restraint upon the War Correspondent’s power of all-embracing
observation. Even of conflicts like Königgrätz and
Sedan, a pretty complete description of a general kind could
always be given by one pen by reason of the smoke which
betrayed the whereabouts of friend and foe and the fluctuations of
the fight; but now that science has robbed war of one of its
most picturesque appendages, a modern battle by day is a most
bewildering spectacle. You hear the roar of cannon and the rattle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of musketry, but this incessant thunder is accompanied by no
lightning-flash. You see men flinging up their arms and falling
around you, but know not whence they received their death-wounds
any more than if they had been stricken down by the
invisible arrows of the Sun-God Apollo.</p>

<p class='c011'>Naturally enough this must have a most demoralising effect on
all soldiers, and when Blücher at Lingy said: ‘My men like to see
the enemy,’ he was only characterising the fighting men of most
nations. Still, as far as I could discover, the German Infantry
were less disconcerted by these unseen terrors of modern war than
were their Russian foes, who are most dour and indomitable devils
when they can fight shoulder to shoulder and in the mass, but lose
much of their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> and their dogged powers of resistance when
each man has mainly to rely upon his own intelligence (not a very
marked feature of the Slavonic soldier), his own initiative, and his
own isolated sources of courage. Indeed, we thought we could
now and then detect traces of panic among the soldiers of the
Czar; and in one case, at least, we distinctly saw an officer draw
his revolver on some of his men who would rather have fled than
fallen before a foe whom they could neither see nor feel.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite, however, of these demoralising influences which were
at work among the scattered ranks of the Russians, they held their
ground with singular tenacity; and the battle had thus raged for
hours without our being able to carry out completely our main
purpose, which was, under cover of the feint attack that we had
directed against the enemy’s centre, to turn his right and roll him
up—a manœuvre, as we knew, which Prince George of Saxony
was equally fain to accomplish with the Russian left.</p>

<p class='c011'>About noon, however, the scales of victory were suddenly
turned in our favour in the following manner. The day was bright,
clear, and warm, and though the battlefield immediately in front
of the knoll occupied by King Albert and his Staff (to which I
had attached myself) was completely free from powder-smoke, the
horizon behind the Russians all at once began to grow clouded with a
long line of thick yellow dust, which floated ever nearer and nearer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to us in dense billowy volumes like a huge, irregular wave of muddy
sea foam. I saw the King exchange glances of intelligent meaning
with the various members of his Staff, but did not myself comprehend
the meaning of the phenomenon, until the rolling dust-cloud
began to be relieved by sparks and glintings such as are emitted
by mica from a grey hillside, and then it flashed upon me all at
once that these coruscations of light in a whirlwind of dust could
only come from the flashing of the sun’s rays on the sabres,
helmets, and lances of our cavalry.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it was. For our Two Divisions of Horse, numbering
in all thirty-two squadrons, starting betimes, had stolen away
through Lowitz, up the right bank of the Bzura, and fording this
stream above its confluence with the Ravka, had mounted this
other brook and crossed it at Bolimoff, where they were fairly in
the rear of the Russian right, on which they thus came thundering
down. I had seen operations of this kind repeatedly carried out at
the autumn manœuvres in Germany, but deemed them <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kriegspiel</span></i> in
the literal sense of the word—and not to be thought of or hazarded
in real warfare. Yet here was a vivid proof that the Germans are
terribly earnest, even in their military pastimes, and that they
only apply in war what they practise in peace. I daresay, however,
King Albert would never have sanctioned so bold a venture had
he not discovered early in the day that the Russians had shifted
the bulk of their cavalry to their left flank as being the more
exposed of the two, and only left a weak Brigade of Dragoons to
strengthen the natural inaccessibility of their right. It had never
occurred to them as a physical possibility that the Germans,
unperceived by their Cossack scouts, could positively work two
Cavalry Divisions round to their rear; but the Germans had done
so, and, riding down the Dragoon Brigade in question, it rushed
with a ringing cheer like a whirlwind upon the Russian battalions
and smote them hip and thigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Becoming aware, though all too late, of this impending
avalanche of squadrons in their rear, the Russians had faced about
with wonderful alacrity and steadiness, and delivered a well-directed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>volley against their assailants, emptying a very considerable
number of saddles; but though this staggered them a little, it
did not in the least stop the long audacious wave of horsemen,
who, couching their lances (for the German cavalry of all kinds
are now armed with this weapon), rode full tilt at the lines of
Russian marksmen, stabbing and spearing them as they so
stubbornly stood their ground. The shock and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> were all over
in less time than it takes to tell of it, and having thus performed
their dare-devil and death-dealing ride through the shattered ranks
of Gourko’s infantry, the gallant squadrons put spurs to their
jaded steeds, and with another rousing cheer came galloping across
to our lines, through which they passed amid ringing salvoes of
cheers, retiring into the hollow ground beyond to rally and re-form—though
very much thinned in numbers, it must be admitted.
It was an heroic feat, executed at a great cost of life and limb;
but it had completed the demoralisation among the ranks of the
Russian infantry which our invisible musketry fire had begun,
and paved the way for the crowning manœuvre of the day.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was performed by our reserve Division of Infantry (the
8th), which, imitating the strategy of the Prussian Guards at Chlum,
had edged its way round and taken the Russians full on their
right flank, which it was now rapidly rolling up and forcing in
upon the centre in huddled masses of demoralised and defeated
troops of all arms. At the same time it was clear, from certain
signs on the extreme right, that our army of the Vistula had
succeeded in performing a similar turning movement in its
particular part of the field (where the bulk of the Russian Cavalry
had bravely, but vainly, attempted to stem the tide of our advance);
and by two o’clock in the afternoon our line of battle had assumed
something like semi-circular shape, which was ever narrowing
down upon our out-manœuvred opponents.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time a general advance on our side had been ordered,
and our Corps Artillery, after raining another most awful torrent
of shells on the Russian position, now slackened and gradually
stopped its fire, in order to let our infantry do the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>bloody work unhampered by the fire of their own guns. Our
infantry, indeed, were only too eager to finish its terrible task;
and although whole ranks were mown down before it could
succeed in ousting the enemy from the field entrenchments, which
ran bastion-like all round their position in Skierniwiçe, still
Teutonic courage and discipline proved more than equal to Russian
doggedness, and volley after volley of the Mauser repeater soon
filled Gourko’s trenches with heaps of dead and wounded.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE STORMING OF SKIERNIWIÇE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The townlet of Skierniwiçe was in flames, and no longer
afforded shelter to its defenders; the chateau itself (with all its
three-Emperor memories) had been converted into a heap of smoking
ruins; the Russian batteries had been reduced to silence as
much by our long-range rifle-fire as by our own field guns; the wood
had also been rendered untenable by our encompassing it on three
sides; and so nothing remained to be done but storm the position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>at the point of the bayonet. It is marvellous how troops can so
dispose themselves as to escape observation in a terrain not over
rich in natural and artificial cover; for the general advance had
not been sounded long before reserve companies and battalions
seemed to start from out the very earth and join in the universal
rush forward upon the Russians, as they began to waver and
finally give way all along the line. By one battalion a determined
stand was made at the railway station, where there was some
desperate hand-to-hand fighting that recalled the butchery of
Bazeilles; but here, too, German obstinacy and valour carried the
day; and as the ‘Old Dessauers’ had distinguished themselves by
the capture of the Russian battery at Vlokavek, so now it was
reserved to the 2d battalion of that same regiment to storm, with
colours flying and kettle-drums beating, the final foothold of
Gourko’s gallant Muscovites on the field which had been selected
by him and his fellow-commander as the Waterloo of this portion
of the war.</p>

<p class='c011'>By three o’clock the Russians were in full retreat on Warsaw
and its ring of formidable forts, leaving us in undisputed possession
of Skierniwiçe with all its stores and strategical advantages.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be impossible to estimate our own losses as well as
those of our foes for some hours yet; but on both sides the
carnage has been fearful, very much heavier, indeed, in view of the
relative numbers of troops engaged, than were ever suffered by
any combatants in the Franco-German or Russo-Turkish wars.
But it is some little consolation, at least, to think that the ambulance
arrangements of the Germans have kept pace with the
improved methods of mass-murder called modern warfare, and the
crowds of wounded, both Germans and Russians, are being well
attended to.</p>

<p class='c011'>The meeting between our victorious commanders, the King of
Saxony and his brother, Prince George, after the battle, was of a
most touching and affectionate kind, recalling the historic scene at
Königgrätz, in which King William and his heroic son, ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unser
Fritz</span>,’ were the chief figures.</p>

between the combined Russian forces thereabouts and an Austrian
army 250,000 strong, which is said to have resulted in the
complete repulse of Dragomiroff, who is retreating towards Lublin,
on the Warsaw line. Should this rumour prove true, it is probable
that Dragomiroff will also retire on Warsaw to join hands with
Gourko and the Grand Duke Vladimir, in which case it is not
unlikely that the present war will be productive of another
Gravelotte and another Metz.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The telegraph will have already kept you well informed of the
various details in the development of the Franco-Italian portion
of the present great European war; but having been enabled, by a
series of lucky chances, to follow the main incidents of the Italian
uprising until now, perhaps you might care to receive from me, by
way of supplement to what you have already published, a brief
general record of my observations.</p>

<p class='c011'>I happened to be in Rome when the telegram was received
there announcing that France had drawn her sword on Germany.
I was first made aware of the fact by a large tumultuous crowd,
which came surging and shouting past my window (a back one) of
the Hôtel de Londres, on the Piazza di Spagna, shouting out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>‘<em>evvivas</em>’ for Germany and the Triple Alliance. This crowd had
come rolling down from the Pincio, where the splendid band of
the Carabinieri—second to none in Europe—had been discoursing
delightful music, and where a special edition of the <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Popolo Romano</span></cite>
had disseminated the news, which was not, indeed, wholly unexpected,
that France, profiting by the embarrassments of Germany
on her Eastern frontier, had risen with a cry of vengeance to
spring upon the Rhine. One man had jumped up on the bandstand
of the Carabinieri and read out this telegram to the listening
throng, which then, as if by pre-concert, burst out into ringing
cheers for King Humbert and the German Emperor; while the
band swelled the chorus of these enthusiastic acclamations by
playing the Italian Air and the ‘<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wacht am Rhein</span></cite>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, starting off for the Quirinal, the crowd came rolling
down by the Church of La Trinità dei Monti, and through the
Via Sistina, where I hastened to join it, and where it stopped
before the house in which Signor Crispi modestly occupies a
third-floor flat. In compliance with the clamours of the mob, the
ex-premier, the advocate and author of Italy’s share in the Triple
Alliance, presented himself on his balcony, and bowed his acknowledgments
to the cheering mass below; but, declining in the
circumstances to make a speech, he only waved his hand, and
pointed in the direction of the Quirinal, to which, accordingly, the
multitude now again headed with tumultuous haste.</p>

<p class='c011'>After rushing up the flight of steps leading to the Quirinal, we
found the spacious area in front of the Royal Palace already filled
with similar contingents of the populace from other parts of the
city; some of the demonstrationists having even clambered up and
taken their stand on the pedestals of the equine masterpieces of
Phidias, familiar to all visitors to Rome, while a very considerable
element in the vast assemblage was formed by the black-robed
and tonsured gentlemen from the other side of the river, who had
come to witness the birth of events which might be pregnant with
consequences for them and their aspirations. And from these
priestly figures, with their pale and pensive faces, I could not help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>letting my eye wander across the intervening valley to the lofty
windows of the Vatican, where perchance the self-imprisoned
successor of St. Peter was trying, with the aid even of a telescope,
to make out the meaning of all this popular commotion in front of
the palace of the royal inheritor of all his worldly glory—to make
out the meaning of it all, and wonder whether the stirring events
now being fashioned in the crucible of war might possibly result
in restoring to him some shreds and patches of his temporal power.</p>

<p class='c011'>But these reveries of mine were speedily dispelled by another
roar of acclamation from the multitude, which had parted and
formed a lane, as did the waters of the Red Sea at the sight of
Moses and his mantle, to let some one pass out from the Royal
Palace. It was the Marquis di Rudini, accompanied by two of
his secretaries, who had just left the Council presided over by the
King, and was crossing over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Cheer after cheer greeted this appearance of the man who,
although he had stepped into the ministerial shoes of Signor
Crispi, was known to have espoused his popular foreign policy;
and the crowd could scarcely be prevented from shouldering him
high and bearing him into his official residence. The crowd had
barely closed round the portal of the Ministry when it had again
to open up a lane to admit the passage of a carriage containing the
German Ambassador, Count Solms, who had hastened hither from
his palace on the Capitoline with a very grave face indeed. But
when he re-emerged from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in about
twenty minutes’ time, the clouds had lifted from his refined countenance,
and he returned the salutations of the crowd with a grave
smile of satisfaction. Quick to draw its own conclusions, the
multitude set up another shout, and began to clamour for Rudini.
Yielding at last to the loud and continuous solicitations of the
Roman populace, the Marquis stepped out upon the balcony of the
Ministry, and, after signifying his wish for silence, addressed his
hearers to the following effect:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Gentlemen, this is at once a serious and a sublime moment,
but as it is a time more for action than for words, my remarks must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>be brief. France, as you know, has drawn the sword on Germany,
and Italy must be true to her loyal ally. (A burst of cheering.)</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Italy entered into certain treaty obligations, which she is now
required to fulfil; and Italy will now fulfil them. (Frantic cheers.)</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The die is cast, and we must redeem our pledges at all risks;
for our honour is at stake, and our national existence would be
nothing without our national honour. (Loud “<em>evvivas</em>.”)</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This is the first time that Italy, as a united nation, has been
called upon to show the stuff whereof she is made; and with
God’s help she will justify the love that has been lavished, as
well as the hopes that have been placed upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I need only add that orders have been issued for the immediate
mobilising of all our brave army; and that the steps of
this army will be accompanied by the fervent prayer of every true
Italian—and we are all true Italians—from the sunny plains of
Sicily to the snow-clad peaks of the Alps. (Great cheering.)</p>

<p class='c011'>‘<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Italia farà da se. Evviva il Re Humberto! Evviva l’imperatore
di Germania! Evviva la tripla Allianza!</span>’</p>

<p class='c011'>Loud and long-continued cheering followed this speech of the
Marquis Rudini (which was presently again to serve as the substance
of a more elaborate oration in the Chamber); but with his
exit from the balcony of the Foreign Office I may fitly drop my
curtain on this opening scene of the Italian War-drama, which
your space will only allow me to portray in one or two representative
sketches, but not describe in detail.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE COUNCIL OF WAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The scene of the next incident which I have to record was
the Ministry of War, one of the hugest buildings in Rome (for
in every country of the Continent is not the architecture of war
rapidly dwarfing the structures of religion?), where King Humbert
presided over a Council composed of his military and naval
magnates, including the Generals commanding the twelve Army
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Corps of the monarchy, and the Admirals of the Fleet, who had
been summoned by telegraph to the capital to advise as to the
course of action which should be adopted against France. The
General Staff, it is true, had already worked out a plan of campaign
for the contingency of such a war; but the situation, as
it now stood, presented elements of doubt and difficulty which
had not been wholly foreseen, and it was therefore necessary to
deliberate as to how the Italian army should be divided and
disposed of in existing circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main question was: how many Army Corps could be
hurled against France? and this question again was subordinate to
the consideration of how many would be required to guard the
coasts of Italy against a French descent. Moreover, the fact
underlying both these questions, as pointed out by the King, was
the absence of any hope that England would, for the present at
least, see her way to give the aims of the Triple Alliance more
than her mere moral support. Had England, for a due consideration,
formally joined the Alliance, and placed her fleet at the
disposal of Italy, thus securing her against all danger of French
aggression, or counter-strokes, by sea, the whole Italian army
would have been free to operate in the field against France; but,
as it was, Italy had to face the possibility of a descent at various
parts of her open and extensive sea-board by a French force of at
least four Army Corps. France had already sent thirteen of her
twenty Corps towards the Rhine; but the seven other garrisoning
her Southern and South-western Departments had not yet received
their marching orders; and at any moment some of them might
be poured down to Marseilles and Toulon within a few hours’
sailing of the Italian coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>The opinion of the War Council was very much divided as to
what should be done, Generals Pianell and Bariola acting as
spokesmen of the two divergent parties; but at length, on the
motion of General Cosenz, Chief of the Staff, whose view was
supported by the King, it was resolved in the meantime to intrust
the task of falling on the flank of France to the 1st, 2d, 3d and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>4th Corps, while the 6th and 7th would act as a reserve, and the
others remain behind to adapt themselves to the development of
events, especially if the French were to suffer reverses on the
Rhine and be thus compelled to denude the Southern Departments
of their garrisons.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then as to the line of attack, the line, that is to say, by which
the Italians should seek to enter France, the Council—but here
my informant, who was present, begged me to exercise the patience
which I would now similarly seek to enjoin upon your readers.
I may add that by the time the Council had finished its deliberations,
the Marquis Rudini had sent to the evening papers the
text of the German-Italian Treaty of Alliance, of which the terms
are analogous to the Austro-German one published by Prince
Bismarck a few years ago, stipulating for a mutual guarantee of
territorial integrity, and providing that, in the event of either
Germany or Italy being attacked by France, the other Power
should at once take the field in its defence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ITALIAN ROUTE—THROUGH THE RIVIERA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From Rome I went to Spezzia, where a friend had promised to
take me on board his yacht; and here I found a formidable ironclad
squadron, consisting of the <em>Italia</em>, the <em>Andrea Doria</em>, the
<em>Francisco Morosimi</em>, the <em>Re Umberto</em>, the <em>Rugiero di Lauria</em>,
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Affondatore</span></i> (turret-ram), and several other vessels of the
second class, preparing to put to sea. What could be the objective
of this fleet? On this point all the naval authorities were as
silent as the grave; but a few more days were to solve the mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our own destination was Monte Carlo, where we anchored our
yacht in the pretty little bay of Monaco, and, going ashore, found
the army of the Prince—consisting of about sixty-five carabineers—in
no small state of excitement, owing to the prospect of its
being forced perhaps by circumstances to abandon its attitude of
armed neutrality, and sucked into the whirlpool of hostilities,
whereof the Riviera might so soon become the sanguinary scene.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>But such a prospect had not the least apparent terror for the
visitors to the beautiful Inferno at Monte Carlo—men and women
of all nations—Jews and Gentiles, Elamites and Assyrians—who,
in spite of the military bustle going on around them—French
battalions of Chasseurs and Alpine troops arriving and departing
by road and rail—continued to frequent the tables of the Casino
with an all-engrossing passion for their occupation worthy of the
abstruse philosopher of Syracuse. ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noli turbare circulos meos</span></i>,’
also exclaimed these lost-to-all-else worshippers of the roulette
wheels.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not, perhaps, generally known in England, but the fact is
that during the last few years the French have been busy constructing
a formidable line of forts all along the Riviera from
Marseilles to Mentone; and every commanding peak and mountain-top
overlooking the sea and the seaside road is capped with
one of these terrifically strong stone-works. Careless pleasure-seekers
on the Riviera are not likely to take special notice of
these mountain-crowns, with heavy long-range guns for their
jewels; but there they are, all the same. They form, indeed,
France’s silent answer to the Triple Alliance, and were placed
there since the conclusion of that pact to bar the advance of Italy,
should that Power, in fulfilment of her treaty engagements with
Germany, be called upon to assail the flank of France, and select
as her line of attack the sea-board rather than the mountain route.</p>

<p>ITALIAN ARTILLERY CROSSING THE MONT CENIS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>An important reason why the Italian army should prefer the
Riviera road into France with all its perils was that, apart from
the natural difficulties of the Alpine routes, which had rather
increased than diminished since the time of Hannibal and Cæsar,
they were unwilling—such was their loyalty to public law—to
expose themselves to the charge of infringing the neutrality either
of Switzerland or of Savoy. For it must be remembered that,
even after it had changed hands with Nice in 1860, Savoy, this
section, so to speak, of the Franco-Italian Alsace-Lorraine, continued
subject to the Treaty of Vienna (1815) as neutral territory,
part of which, Chablais and Faucigny, might even be occupied
with Federal troops ‘in the event of Switzerland’s neighbours
being in a state of open or imminent warfare.’ Indeed, a portion
of the Federal Army had already made bold to brave the displeasure
and even the reprisals of France by occupying as it was,
theoretically speaking, entitled to do, the upper part of Savoy;
and this had introduced into the military situation an element of
complexity which the Italians would have been foolish to ignore.
Consequently, they resolved to force the passage of the Riviera
road—the more so as their fleet could cover their march to some
extent, and even land troops at particular points, as long at least,
at the other portions of the French navy, at present engaged in
the Baltic and elsewhere, should not be free to make for the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italians had also resolved to send another smaller army,
consisting of their 1st and 3d Corps (whose places in the army of
the Riviera were to be taken by the 6th and 8th), across the Alps
by the Mont Cenis route, so as thus to attempt to turn the flank
of the French Army, consisting mainly of the 7th, 14th, 15th, and
16th Corps, which were now pretty well all the French could spare
from the further draft they had had to make on their military
resources with a view to repair their reverses on the Rhine.</p>

    <div>MOUNTAIN WARFARE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I need not describe to you in detail, for that has doubtless
already been done for you, the incidents of the preliminary fighting
between the two armies—French and Italian—since the first outpost
collision at Ventimiglia, and the first serious collision near
Mentone. You are sure to have heard of all the thrilling incidents
forming the prelude to the drama—the splendid but unavailing
defence that was made by the 24th Battalion of French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Chasseurs from Ville-Franche against the irresistible onslaught of
the Bersaglieri of the 4th Italian Corps; the brilliant cavalry
encounter between the 5th Italian Lancers and the French
Dragoons of Tarascon (Tartarin’s native place on the Rhone); the
exploits of the Italian Alpini, or Alpine Sharpshooters, in scouting
and hill-climbing that would put to shame the records of the Alpine
Club; the wonders of marching and ‘milling’ (if I may use a
slang word) done by the mule-borne mountain-batteries of either
belligerent: the obstinate artillery duels between the Italian ironclads
which steam along the coast and the bastioned stone-work
batteries that crown the mountain-tops; with all the other novel
features in this almost fascinating picture of bloody war set in
such a beautiful framework of blue sky and purple hills, o’erlooking
a paradise of flowers.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c011'>The Battle of Hyères, or rather of Costebelle (where Queen
Victoria lately passed a few quiet and peaceful weeks), though it
resulted in the repulse of the French, and their retirement on
Toulon, is not quite decisive of the campaign, as it will be next to
impossible for the Italians to possess themselves of this formidable
and important place, even with the aid of their fleet, before getting
reinforcements from Italy, which cannot for the present be spared;
and meanwhile the Brest Squadron of the French Fleet may be
able to get rid of its embarrassments elsewhere and come round to
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c011'>The situation, no doubt, will be simplified if General Ricotti,
with his two Corps, manages to debouch from the Alps on the
Mont Cenis side, and, disposing of all opposition in that quarter,
come down the valley of the Rhone to co-operate with the army
of the Riviera. But, in the meantime, the issue of the whole war
may have been decided on the Vistula and the Rhine; and, if so, then
the Italians will have accomplished their chief aim, which was to
distract and hamper the forces of France, by creating a diversion
on her flank and rear, and thus render her defeat by the Germans
all the easier and all the more certain.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>In any case, the victories already achieved by the Italians
show them to be possessed of splendid soldierly material, both in
men and officers—material in no single respect inferior to that of
France; and when, after the late battle of Costebelle, the German
Emperor telegraphed to King Humbert that ‘his troops had done
things of which their Prussian comrades themselves might very
well be proud, and which at least they had never surpassed even
at Rossbach and Sedan,’ it must have been felt by all the world
that His German Majesty, in employing the phrases of compliment,
was only using the language of truth.</p>

    <div><em>To the Editor of ‘Black and White.’</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I observe that some confusion has arisen as to the
authorship of the letters from the Baltic and North Sea relating to
the terrible war now raging. They are not mine. The author is
my friend, Sir Rambleton Seaforth, who was on his wedding trip,
and has certainly had a remarkable experience in that way. He
is only a yachtsman, not a naval man, or he would have no doubt
been able to give us fuller details, and a more correct view of the
situation. The letters were written to me, and not intended for
publication, and I much fear I shall be hauled over the coals when
he comes home. But I shall answer him with the truth, which
was that his sister stole them off my desk and sent them to you
without asking my leave.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am sorry to say that the pair did not come to the end of
their adventures in the <em>Thames</em>. On her way into Sheerness she
was ordered by signal to transfer her despatches into a picket-boat,
which was sent out to her, and to proceed at once to Plymouth.
As Sir Rambleton’s place is in Devonshire, he and his wife decided
to go on in her. Unfortunately, when she made her number off
the Start, she was signalled to proceed at once off Cape Finisterre
for the protection of commerce, and to coal at Ferrol, but not to
call there till actually short of coal. She asked leave to land her
passengers, and was refused, so Sir Rambleton and his wife are at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>sea off Finisterre now, if they have not been captured and carried
into a French port, as it was stated that quite a cloud of French
cruisers had been ordered to rendezvous at that point.—I am, Sir,
your obedient servant,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was not till May 7th that our Correspondent’s letter (<em>see
page <a href='#Page_102'>102</a></em>) announcing the reported arrival of English troops in
Trebizonde was published in London. It had been delayed in
transmission. Meantime, on May 3d, the day following the debate
in the House of Commons, the proclamation calling out the
Reserves was posted throughout the kingdom. It appears that
warning notices, issued as secretly as possible, had been sent out
four days earlier, following the precedent set in 1882. On May
6th Mr. Balfour gave notice that he should on May 10th ask for
a credit vote in the House of Commons for ten millions, and for
authority to call out the Militia. On the reception of the news
received from our Correspondent, however, a hasty conference of
the Liberal leaders, which met at Mr. Gladstone’s house, decided
that, as it would be inconvenient to have a debate in the House of
Commons prior to that on the credit vote on May 10th, Lord Kimberley
should on Monday night, May 9th, ask for explanations of
Lord Salisbury, and notice was at once sent to Lord Salisbury to
that effect. On the afternoon of May 9th the House of Lords was
crowded from floor to ceiling. All the Princes were in their places.
The House of Commons occupied the whole of the space at the bar
in a dense mass. The galleries were filled with the Princesses and
Peeresses.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Amid breathless silence, Lord Kimberley rose. In a few
cautiously worded sentences he expressed a hope that Lord
Salisbury would be able to give an unqualified contradiction to the
ridiculous rumour which had reached England. He referred, of
course, to the report of a correspondent that as long ago as April
29th, English troops, the forerunners of an English expedition,
either had landed, or were immediately about to land, at Trebizonde.
The House was ready to support the Ministry in every
measure which they might take to safeguard the honour and interests
of England. No part of the House was more zealous in
that respect than those noble Lords with whom he had the honour
to be associated. But a landing at Trebizonde implied something
which in no way concerned the honour and interests of England.
It was impossible that their Lordships should not be led by it to
suppose that the noble Marquis, the head of the Government, considered
himself bound by that ridiculous compact, the Cyprus Convention,
and that he now felt himself called upon to draw the
sword of England in defence of Turkey, because Russia had crossed
the Asiatic frontier of Turkey. However few the Liberal Peers in
that House might be, they felt that they expressed the mind of
England in declaring to the noble Marquis that, in behalf of the
corrupt Government of Turkey, the sword of England ought never
again to be drawn. As for the Cyprus Convention, it had been
abrogated by Turkey herself. It was conditional, and the conditions
had not been fulfilled. Speaking with the authority of many
able military men, he could assure the noble Marquis that if he
contemplated a campaign amid the mountains of Asia Minor, a
campaign which, even if successful, could only lead up to a long
and dreary siege of the Russian fortress of Kars, he was involving
the country in military difficulties of untold magnitude and limitless
duration. He was doing this at a time when, amid a universal
conflagration, we required all our forces for the complications
which were sure to arise both in Europe and in Asia.</p>

<p>LORD SALISBURY ADDRESSING THE HOUSE OF LORDS ON THE QUESTION OF PEACE AND WAR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>There was rather a buzz of excitement than any definite applause
when the noble Lord sat down. It was promptly hushed,
as Lord Salisbury immediately rose to reply. He spoke as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘My Lords, I do not require the assurance of the noble Earl
that your House is ready to support Her Majesty’s Government in
any steps which may be indispensable to safeguard the honour and
interests of England. I cannot discuss with that freedom which
the noble Earl, naturally as an independent Peer, allows himself,
the character of the Government of our ally, the Sultan of Turkey,
or the present position of the Cyprus Convention. Happily for
the explanation which I am glad to have this opportunity of offering
to your Lordships, it is wholly unnecessary for me to refer to
either. We have never professed ourselves ready to support the
Government of the Sultan against his Christian subjects, should
that contingency arise. But there is one thing on which I think
it is well that Europe should understand, that not only this House,
but the whole of England, is agreed. We do not desire to see the
independent Balkan States crushed beneath the heel of Russia.
We do not desire to see the population of Asia Minor pass from
the Government of the Turk to that of the Czar. I am unwilling
to say all that I easily might say on that subject at the present
moment. War between us and Russia has not been declared.
Our relations are in so delicate a condition that I should have
asked the noble Earl to postpone his question, but that I feared
that might give rise to misunderstanding. We live in hope that
such a dire calamity as a war between us and Russia may yet be
averted by the wisdom and the notoriously peaceful disposition of
the Czar. But the situation is this. Russia has commenced by
sea an attack upon Bulgaria. In order to say nothing that may
tend to aggravate the difficulties of the present moment, I refrain
from referring to the circumstances which preceded that invasion.
In any case, it has been impossible for us to allow Bulgaria to be
crushed when the support of our fleet would be of the most
material importance to her. We, on hearing of the Russian invasion,
at once issued orders to Sir George Tryon to act under the instructions
of our ambassador at Constantinople. With the consent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of the Sultan, the fleet under Sir George Tryon entered the Black
Sea five days after the Russians had effected their landing in Bulgaria.
We then intimated to the Czar that we could not allow any
further reinforcements to be carried to Varna, and we heard yesterday
that the Russian fleet, yielding to the superior force of ours,
had retreated to the harbour of Sebastopol. The roadstead of
Varna is in occupation of our cruisers. The Russians have advanced
inland, leaving a force to cover the siege of Varna, which is
held by about 5000 Bulgarians. It was in consequence of the
Turks having announced their intention of supporting their vassal
State, Bulgaria, that the Russian troops, without any declaration of
war, crossed the frontiers in Asia Minor. As it had been at our
instance that Turkey had agreed to give support to the Bulgarians,
it was impossible that we could leave her without a pledge of our
support when this aggression took place. It is not a political
question of the future destinies of Asia Minor as between Turkey
and the Armenian population. It is simply a question of giving
military support to a valuable ally during actual warfare. We
cannot afford to throw away the assistance of thousands of most
valiant soldiers, who are ready to support our just demand that
the Balkan States shall be allowed to pursue in tranquillity that
orderly development which has excited the astonishment and the
admiration of Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘As to the military dangers which the noble Earl apprehends, I
think that it would be highly inconvenient, at a time when it is at
least possible that actual war may follow, that we should discuss,
for the information of those against whom we may have to fight,
our military projects. It will, I think, be sufficient for me to say
that we have intrusted the conduct of the whole of these operations
to a member of your Lordships’ House, in whom we have
complete confidence, and whose name will be a guarantee to the
country that nothing will be wanting in the command of the war,
should it unfortunately be forced upon us, which will tend to the
honour and success of the British arms. The gallant Viscount,
the present Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, whom I am glad to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>see in his place to-night, will, I have no doubt, be quite prepared
to accept responsibility for any dangers which trouble the imagination
of the noble Earl. But I should suppose that he will prefer
to discuss his plans with him after rather than before the war. It
is not in presence of armies which, as we have recently seen,
are conducted with absolute secrecy, and are able to deliver unexpected
blows, because no one knows what is going to happen till
the stroke falls, that we can afford to discuss our arrangements in
the face of the world. The gallant Viscount has at least fully
satisfied Her Majesty’s Government that he has a complete grasp
of the whole situation, that he knows his own mind, and we accept
full responsibility for all that he proposes to do. If you do not
trust us, replace us by those whom you do trust. But, in Heaven’s
name, let me implore you not to allow the strength of England at
this moment to be weakened by divided counsels or by want of
confidence in those to whom the conduct of military affairs is
intrusted. At this moment it may make the whole difference
between our obtaining by peaceful means the acceptance of our
just demands and a war which must be terrible and may be long.
In any case, should war break out, the firm attitude of the whole
country, its patriotic resolve and a temporary abstinence from feeble
criticism will have a most decisive effect upon the future.’</p>

<p class='c011'>When Lord Salisbury sat down there was a momentary and
most impressive hush, as of awed silence, in presence of the
tremendous events which appeared to be imminent, and then there
came from all parts of the House a burst of general and enthusiastic
cheering, all the more striking because of the usually impassive
attitude of that august assembly. The ladies in the gallery
for a moment rose altogether as by a single impulse, and when
they sat down not a few of them burst into tears from excitement,
while a buzz of eager talk filled both House and galleries.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the excitement had a little quieted down, Lord Rosebery,
in a few short sentences, expressed his entire sympathy with
the general policy enunciated by Lord Salisbury. He could not,
however, refrain from hoping that we were not about to be committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to a dangerous and difficult campaign in Asia Minor, where
the roads were bad, the country difficult, and the end uncertain.
He had, however, complete confidence in the prudence and military
genius of the gallant Viscount, and had no wish to hamper either
him or the Government with untimely criticism.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general effect throughout the country of the debate in the
House of Lords decided the Liberal leaders to allow Mr. Balfour’s
application for the credit vote to pass unchallenged. Mr.
Labouchere, however, moved the rejection of the vote, and was
seconded by Sir Wilfrid Lawson. The credit was voted by a
majority of 412 to 17. We do not propose to trouble our readers
with the details of the debate. No one took Mr. Labouchere very
seriously, and Sir Wilfrid Lawson’s jokes, which by no means
suited the temper of the House, may be found scattered through
his previous speeches. With the exception of two or three peace-at-any-price
members, nearly the whole of those who followed Mr.
Labouchere consisted of Parnellite members, who avowedly voted
only in order to show their independence of Mr. M‘Carthy and of
both political parties. The funniest incident occurred when Sir
Wilfrid Lawson, whose own position was an absolutely isolated
one, repeated his old proposals to boycott the army. The humour
of the situation took the fancy of the House, and a general titter
gradually broke into a roar of laughter as the honourable member,
either not appreciating the point, or wilfully blind, exclaimed,
‘Well, I shall!’ It was the only opportunity which members had
for relieving pent-up feeling, and they indulged it freely.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>CALLING OUT THE RESERVE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meantime the mobilisation of that portion of the 1st Army
Corps, which was not moved with Sir Evelyn Wood to Antwerp,
proceeded. It is necessary to explain what was and was not done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>in the case of the regiments that went to Antwerp. The troops at
Aldershot were gradually increased, with a view nominally to the
summer drills, till they numbered something under 12,000 men.
To these, for the purposes of the expedition, were added three
battalions of the Guards from London, two of the regiments of
Household Cavalry, and two batteries of Field Artillery from
Woolwich.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE MOBILISATION OF THE ENGLISH ARMY—TROOPS MARCHING THROUGH THE DOCK GATES, PORTSMOUTH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It must, however, be understood that in the proper sense of
the term these regiments could not be ‘mobilised.’ <em>There is at
this moment no battalion in the whole kingdom, except those of the
Guards, that is fit to go on active service as it stands on parade.</em> The
battalions are filled with recruits who, when mobilisation is
ordered, have, in the first instance, to be replaced with men from
the Reserve. This cannot be done without a proclamation, and
without the fact of the Reserves being called out being known to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>everybody. For such a sudden movement as Mr. Balfour announced
in the House of Commons on May 2d, there are no
troops but the Guards ordinarily available; but when application
was made to the military authorities to know how soon it would
be possible to carry out a move of this kind, it was pointed out,
in the first instance, that the occupation of a fortress like Antwerp
is a very different thing from a campaign in the field. It would do
no harm to the young troops to be moved across sea to Belgium.
There they would be comfortably housed, and when mobilisation
was ordered it would be easy to send over to that quarter the
Reserve men to take their place in the ranks. Indeed, it was
pointed out that this course would be positively advantageous. For
supposing that Sir Evelyn Wood’s troops were required for a campaign
elsewhere, it would be best to replace them in Antwerp by
forming <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôts</span> there of recruits who with, perhaps, a few Militia
regiments, who might be induced to volunteer for the purpose,
would form a sufficient garrison; since it was in the last degree
unlikely that, with all they had on their hands, any of the armies
in the field would attempt a siege of such a fortress as Antwerp,
occupied by English troops, even though young and raw. As
soon as the probability of the Eastern expedition arose, we believe
that Lord Wolseley pointed out that it was indispensable to carry
out this plan. As the Reserves for the battalions now at Antwerp
came in at the home stations they were shipped over to that town,
and in fact all arrived there about the 9th of this month.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Thomas Baker has, we understand, been sent over to Antwerp
to take command of that garrison as soon as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôts</span> can
be formed. Thus, about the time that we write, the whole of Sir
Evelyn Wood’s force ready to take the field will be available for
service elsewhere. From the all-important point of view of
facilities for embarkation and provision of shipping, this has been
a decided gain. Enormous as are the mercantile resources of
England, and patriotic as has been the readiness of all our great
companies to place their vessels at the disposal of Government, it
has always been assumed that we could not reasonably calculate on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>moving off from our ports at one moment more than about 35,000
troops, or the force of one <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d’armée</span></i>. To move such a force,
with all the carriages, horses, and stores necessary to make the
army available for the field, will require 135 large steamers.
Warning and provisional arrangements had, we understand, been
made, for as many as this, by the transport department of the
Admiralty, when the Government first began to apprehend the
possibility of our having to employ them, nearly a month ago.
But the facilities of the Port of Antwerp have enormously increased
our means of transport. By far the larger portion of the
shipping of that great port is in the hands of English firms, and
the commercial relations between these firms and Germany have
enabled the Government to charter, in addition to a large mass of
Antwerp shipping, many German ships which have been laid up
by the high war rates now ruling for insurance. Thus, virtually
without touching our own shipping or the facilities for embarking
at our ports, Sir Evelyn Wood’s troops, forming about half of the
2d Corps which he is destined to command at the Seat of War,
will be embarked probably before these words see the light.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the troops of the 1st Army Corps have already left
our shores.</p>

<p class='c011'>On May 8th the Duke of Connaught, who is to command the
1st Army Corps, sailed with the Headquarter Staff of that Corps
and the 2d Battalion Scots Guards from the Royal Albert Docks,
North Woolwich, in his old ship, the <em>Orient</em>, which had been
recently docked. His Royal Highness had asked that, if it were
equally convenient, he might travel with the captain and in the
ship in which he had sailed for Egypt in 1882. It was a point of
<em>punctilio</em> with the captain to clear out at exactly the same hour as
in 1882; and accordingly, at twelve o’clock on May 8th, amid the
cheers of a vast crowd, the <em>Orient</em> sailed from Woolwich as in
1882, just five days after the issue of the order calling in the
Reserve men. The other portions of the Corps have sailed within
the last week.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far all speaks well for the efficient working of our system,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>but from our different correspondents at the points where
mobilisation has been taking place, we hear of not a few blots
which mar the harmony of the picture.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first place, an undoubted and severe strain has been
put upon our resources. It is not usual for more than three
battalions of the Guards to leave England at the same time for
active service. The zeal and patriotism of the London Scottish,
the Inns of Court Volunteers, the 20th Middlesex, the Artists’
Corps, induced them to volunteer to take up several of the day
guards in London; special arrangements having been worked out
to make the duties as little irksome as possible, and to arrange for
a free interchange of the men. With the exception of the Bank
Guard, all-night duties have been handed over to the police, and
it is hoped that this arrangement may become a permanent one.
Thus relieved, the single battalion of the Grenadiers left in
London will, it is believed, be sufficient for the indispensable
remainder of the day duties, though we have seen solemn old
heads gravely shaken from the windows of ‘The Rag,’ as they
looked across the way at the policeman who, even for day duty,
has assumed the protection of the War Office and Horse Guards.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus, in addition to the brigade of Guards which moved with
Sir Evelyn Wood to Antwerp, a second Guard Brigade has been
formed for the corps which His Royal Highness is to command.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to the method intended to be the normal one for
our mobilisation, as soon as the 1st Corps has moved off to the
ports of embarkation, their places are to be taken at the stations
they have vacated by the regiments of the 2d Army Corps, who
will then be mobilised, and will subsequently be embarked from
the same ports as the others. This arrangement has been disturbed
by the fact that Sir Evelyn Wood’s troops, forming about a
division and a half of the 1st Army Corps, as originally intended,
were prepared for movement in ample time, it having been
known for nearly a year that such a movement might be required
at any moment. When it was subsequently known that it would
be necessary to send two Army Corps to the seat of war, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>troops from England would necessarily precede those from
Antwerp, the places vacated at Aldershot were taken up by regiments
of the proper 2d Army Corps, and their Reserve men sent
to them there.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>RESERVE MEN SERVED WITH THE NEW MAGAZINE-RIFLE, AND OFF TO THE FRONT TO-MORROW.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As regards the equipment of Sir Evelyn’s force, there was nothing
to find fault with,—the material for the necessary transport and
stores was actually at Aldershot, and, for the Guards, in London.
The troops embarked complete in every respect, except for the
unavoidable absence of their Reserve men, which has now been
supplied. On the whole, the Reserve men have come in very
well, and the deficiency in the calculated numbers is very slight.
The contrast in their age and physique to the boys of the battalions
as we have known them, is very marked. On the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>hand, it is reported that those who have left the colours for some
years show sadly the defects of their not having been called out
regularly for training. Many of them have certainly seen and
handled the magazine-rifle. Others have not even done that. A
certain falling off also in military habits and discipline is perhaps
better indicated in a description which has been given by one of
the correspondents of a trip he took in a railway carriage, with
five men going to join their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">depôt</span> from certain quarries in the
north. We shall abridge his graphic sketch of the men in order
to record the conversation he details.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of them, a big man with sandy whiskers and indifferently
shaved, but evidently a good-natured fellow, clapped him familiarly
on the knee after certain gifts of baccy and a little nip from his
flask, which latter was, however, refused by two out of the five, had
made them all disposed to be communicative. ‘Look ye here, sir,
I doesn’t mind a bit going back for a little soldiering, but it seems
strange like. Why, a few months ago, one of the officers of my
old regiment came down to see us at the quarries where we was.
He was a very nice young officer, had been adjutant, and if I’d
seen him by myself on the road, I’d have liked nothing better
than to touch my hat to him, and get a bit of a chat about old
times. But, lor’ bless yer, if I’d saluted him down in the quarries
I shouldn’t have heard the last of it this side of Christmas. He
seemed rather worried like at the way we treated him, though we
was all glad to see him, and he asked me about it. “Well,” says
I, “the reason the chaps don’t salute you, is just that they darn’t
for fear of the chaff.” “What do yer salute him for? yer needn’t,
yer know,” that’s what all the other men in the quarries would
want to know. Well, yer know, sir, ’tain’t that. It’s a kind of
way of saying as you belong to the same body like as he does.
He’s got his dooty and you’ve got yours. But, lor’ bless you, you
never could make the quarry chaps see that. “See what John
Morley says,” they’d say, “he tells yer it’s rank slavery, and that’s
just what it is. You make believe to like it, cos you’ve lost yer
tail and ’ud like to see other chaps lose theirs.” Well, yer know,
sir, when you’ve been five or six years among that sort o’ thing,
and all the time you haven’t had the chance of so much as seeing a
regiment, and feel that you don’t know nothing about this here
blooming new drill, and about these yer magazine rifles and
smokeless powder as they talks about, well, it seems strange like.
You feel as if your blood had got changed since you was with the
regiment. However, when we went off with a chance of going
away to the war, and even when the Proclamation was fastened
upon the village inn, and the women was howling fit to split, one
old quarryman claps me on the back, and says he, “I’d like to be
going with you, my lad; good luck for old England,” for their
blood got up pretty quick when they heard of the row, and they
like fighting as well as any one.’</p>

the Militia and the state of the proper 2d Army Corps, half of
which will now become the 1st Army Corps under the Duke of
Connaught, and the other half will, with Sir Evelyn’s troops, form
the 2d Army Corps under him.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the last moment we hear that the titles of the Corps which
Sir Evelyn and the Duke of Connaught are to command are
changed. It has been naturally assumed that the Duke of Connaught
would command the 1st Corps, and Sir Evelyn the 2d.
All the correspondents during the week have so reported it, and
we understand that, as a matter of courtesy, this would have been
arranged if possible. But, as Sir Evelyn’s troops all belong to the
1st Army Corps in the mobilisation scheme, and the waggons and
stores were all marked for the ‘1st Army Corps,’ it was found
that to have changed this order would have introduced endless
confusion. On the matter being explained to the Prince, he is
reported to have said that ‘he was a soldier, and could only wish
that what was best for the Service should be considered. He was
proud to serve as brother Corps-commander with so distinguished
a soldier as Sir Evelyn Wood.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Events have ripened fast since last week. Russia, on May 16,
on hearing of the dispatch of our troops to the East, declared war
against us. The excitement against us in France has reached
boiling point. There can be no doubt that our great fleet of convoys
would not have been allowed to leave England had there, at
the time of their departure, seemed to be any prospect of France
declaring war against us, because from Algeria and her southern
ports, she so threatens our movement through the Mediterranean
that that opportunity is in itself an additional incentive to her
to declare war. For a long time, however, it appeared as if the
Ministry, prudently anxious not to add further to the enemies
France already has on her hands, would temporise with us.
Public feeling will, however, it is to be feared, prove too strong
for the Ministry, and for some time the gravest anxiety was felt
at home as to the fate of the expedition in the event of the
fleet being attacked whilst escorting so great a convoy of ships,
while Sir George Tryon was known to be fully occupied in the
Black Sea. On the 18th, however, a telegraphic message arrived
announcing that Sir George Tryon had withdrawn the entire fleet
from the Black Sea immediately after the retreat of the Russian
Fleet to Sebastopol; that his flag-ship had arrived at Malta, that
the Duke of Connaught, in the <em>Orient</em>, had reached Cyprus after
a very rapid and successful voyage; and that all the transports
sailing direct from England had either arrived at or passed
Malta. It is understood that the greater part of the troops of the
1st Army Corps will for the present rendezvous at Cyprus, where
extensive preparations have for a long time past been made for
their reception. Alarm was at first excited in some quarters lest
the troops should suffer as they had done at the time of the first
occupation of Cyprus. But according to the reports from the island
it appears that a great improvement has taken place in its sanitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>condition—thanks to the British occupation; that the chief cause
of the ill-health of the troops at the former time was the want of
proper hutting arrangements, provided for them beforehand. Large
quantities of roofing felt have been sent out, and labourers have
constructed, under the direction of the engineers, large huts
admirably roofed, and now practically ready for about 30,000
men. In case the necessary huts should not be ready for the
whole of the troops, it is understood that the remainder of the force
will land in Egypt. It is obvious that no expedition can be carried
into the Black Sea until the great Naval action, which will almost
certainly follow the French Declaration of War,—which is expected
whilst we write,—has decided which flag is to be supreme in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime, Sir Evelyn Wood’s troops, which sailed from
Antwerp on May 13th and 14th, have temporarily put into
Gibraltar and Cadiz, where they have been received in the most
friendly manner by our present allies the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c011'>The departure from England of the second half of the 2d Corps
has been postponed. The ships are ready, but it is obviously inadvisable
to accumulate more troops on the long line to the East
till the question of the supremacy of the Alliance in the Mediterranean
has been settled. The detachment of troops which was
landed at Trebizonde has necessarily been withdrawn. They would
have been exposed to attack by indefinitely superior force as soon
as the command of the Black Sea passed into the hands of the
Russians. It appears that the detachment never consisted of more
than half a battalion, and a few sappers from the garrison of
Cyprus, which had been reinforced with a view to such a movement.</p>

    <div>MOVEMENT BY THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>London has had the excitement of a pageant unseen since 1854,
and therefore unknown to most of our generation. On May 18th
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the Sergeant-at-Arms, attended by the whole of the city functionaries,
declared war against Russia from the steps of the Royal
Exchange.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST RUSSIA FROM THE STEPS OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is obvious that we may have before long to expect some
aggression of Russia upon Afghanistan. But Russia has already
involved herself in such a number of campaigns, against Germany,
against Austria, against Bulgaria and Turkey, and also against
Turkey in Asia, that it seems in the last degree improbable that,
with her resources impoverished and weakened by the effects of
the great famine, she can employ great force in Afghanistan also.
On our part, however, it is indispensable that we should in India
not expect to carry on a great aggressive campaign against Russia.
For, whereas for a forward campaign large reinforcements, both of
men and officers, would be required, we cannot at present afford
to send any large number of men from home, and even the possible
supply of officers will be very limited.</p>

<p class='c011'>We understand, however, that arrangements have been made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>with the Canadian Pacific Railway for the immediate dispatch to
India by that line of about 200 retired officers who have volunteered
their services, and who having large Indian experience will
be invaluable for many of the appointments that will become indispensable.
One of our ablest and best known artists has made
arrangements to accompany this party. We hope in a future issue
to give a number of graphic illustrations of the new route, which,
now that the Suez Canal is no longer available, from the risks
attending it, fully shows its importance to the safety of the Empire.
We understand that, also by the Canadian Pacific line,
enormous stores of magazine rifles were, none too soon, dispatched
to India about a month ago. Furthermore, about 500 million
cartridges of smokeless powder for the rifles were dispatched about
a fortnight ago by the same route. It was found impossible to
obtain these from the Government factories, which up to the eve of
the war were still experimenting on the form of powder. The
‘Smokeless Powder Company,’ however, undertook to provide
1000 million cartridges as a first instalment. Five hundred
million of them have been assigned as the first provision for
home and the Eastern expedition, and the second instalment was
sent off in hot haste to the East, <em>viâ</em> the West, special arrangements
for its security having been undertaken by the Canadian
Pacific.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MOBILISATION OF THE SECOND CORPS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Meantime it is certainly not to be regretted that we have been
compelled to delay the dispatch from England of the second half
of the 2d Corps. The trooping season to India being now over,
nearly all the drafts had been sent out before the risk of war
appeared imminent. A certain number were, however, kept back
towards the end of the season. Nevertheless, the Reserve men
have barely sufficed to make up the Corps and a half which have
already sailed. It would have been impossible to make up the
remaining half Corps at all, but for the fact that, specially for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>war, a large number of Militiamen and of ‘efficient volunteers’
have offered their services. The ‘efficient volunteers’ have enlisted
under a special clause which expressly limits their services
to the period of the war, and, as a maximum, to a period of two
years. Furthermore, the strength of the Artillery is deplorably
deficient.</p>

<p class='c011'>A short time ago there was fear lest the miscellaneous collection
of weapons with which the Artillery was armed would produce
confusion. This was remedied by activity in the Arsenal,
and by giving out contracts to private firms. The result was the
production of numbers of the so-called 12–pounder gun both for
the Indian and home batteries. Unfortunately this gun has been
condemned by the unanimous report of our ablest artillerymen.
It is too heavy for the Horse Artillery, which loses mobility.
On the other hand, the Field Artillery will have to meet the
guns of Foreign Powers, no one of which throws a shell of less
than 15 pounds. Most of the foreign field guns are even more
powerful. The ammunition is most unsatisfactory. Everything
has been sacrificed to securing an excessive muzzle velocity, which
commends itself very much to mere experimentalists, but is regarded
as useless by practical soldiers.</p>

<p class='c011'>There has been a dangerous tendency to leave these questions
altogether in the hands of an Ordnance Committee of men without
experience of the requirements of an army. For a sporting
rifle, the sportsman says what he wants, and the manufacturer
applies his skill to furnishing what is asked for. For our Artillery
the shopman decides. The men who have to handle the gun in
war, or who have studied the experience of others who have
handled it in war, are simply ignored.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EMBODIMENT OF THE MILITIA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The general embodiment of the militia has shown serious
defects in our system. These are glaring enough among the
English and Scotch militia regiments, but among the Irish they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>are appalling. Many of the Irish militia battalions are now in
the neighbourhood of Aldershot in a special camp. Some of
them, like those of Antrim, Tipperary, Tyrone, are a splendid body
of men. The great deficiency in some of the battalions is in the
correspondence between their numbers and the muster rolls. One
correspondent reports having ascertained that there are not a
few Irish militiamen who have been in the habit of belonging
to as many as five different corps at one time. ‘The way the
thing has been done is this: It has never been the practice to
call out simultaneously the militia battalions for training; it
would interfere inconveniently with the labour market. Certain
men, taking advantage of this fact, have made a regular trade of
getting the money allowed for one battalion after another as it
has been called out. Indeed, so well has the fact been known
that it is reported that not infrequently the Sergeant-Major has
requested the adjutant of certain battalions to beg that the time
of muster might be postponed till after the end of the training of
another battalion, in order to ensure a full attendance. Now,
however, that the battalions are gathered together the effects are
visible enough. I am told that in some battalions nearly half
the proper strength is wanting. Some steps are certainly required
to cure this evil. The men, it must be observed, don’t
“desert” their proper battalion because they attend all their drills.
Perhaps now that the militia is embodied it might be possible,
legally, to try these men as deserters from the corps with which
they do not appear. That, however, is a question for the military
powers, not for your humble correspondent. What I am
quite certain of is that they will not be tried. Our already
slender numbers would be most formidably reduced if all these
men were treated as criminals. Moreover, they are not at bottom
bad fellows many of them. The idea that it is a crime to get
a little more pay out of the public in return for doing a little
more drill never entered their minds. The general effect of their
action, of course, does not affect them at all. “Why, yer honour,
didn’t I put in me toime honest for me pay?” one of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with whom I was expostulating said to me the other day.
They are, of course, the best drilled men we have. They have
had so much of it. For this war, at all events, it is too late to
devise a remedy for this sham.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Just at present the headquarters of the militia are in the
Staff College, that institution having been broken up for the
war, and the sixty officers usually there have been sent to rejoin
their regiments, or to fill up billets where they are badly
wanted. The tents of the militia battalions cover the ground in
the neighbourhood. Aldershot is occupied with the brigades
that are being formed in hot haste to complete the force in
the field. The stores for the 2d Army Corps were by no means
in the same state of readiness as those for the 1st. But in
Aldershot, at least, many of the waggons were actually ready,
and, thanks to the delay which has taken place, and the costly
and feverish purchases all over the country of stores, probably
this portion of the two corps will be ready when it is required
to move.</p>

<p class='c011'>We hear from all parts of the world of enormous purchases of
transport material of all kinds which will be hurried into the
Levant as soon as it is safe to send them there. Mules especially
are being everywhere purchased.</p>

<p class='c011'>The horses that have been of late years registered with the
Government for purchase for war have proved invaluable. Indeed,
without them we could not possibly have equipped the troops.
Many of them are splendid animals, and will greatly assist in
making up our deficiencies in draught horses for the artillery and
train.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CALLING OUT THE VOLUNTEERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>As soon as the excitement in France began to be realised in
this country two opinions strove for mastery. At first there was
some little disposition to insist on the recall of the troops from
all distant expeditions. But in a short time every one saw that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>for this it was practically now too late. A very large portion of
our force was in the Levant already. That force had been
dispatched with the full assent of the country, because in whatever
way it was to be employed, as to which there were all kinds
of conflicting rumours, it was felt that we were now bound in
honour to assist in resisting the Russian attempt to crush Bulgaria.
There was also a certain speculative interest of the ‘What
will he do with it?’ kind, as to the nature of the campaign which
Lord Wolseley has designed. On the whole, though croakers, some
of whom were known not to be altogether exempt from personal
and private pique, are to be heard here and there, a general confidence
prevails. Men record how in ’82, at a time when everyone
thought that Arabi’s power in Egypt was too great for the
English force to overcome without a long campaign, he had
announced and allowed it to be published, before he left England,
that ‘whatever resistance Arabi might offer, the campaign
would be over in three months,’ and how exactly that prediction
had been fulfilled by the return of the English troops within
that time. It is recalled again that, though, after all the delays
that had taken place, it was impossible to say, before the Nile
Campaign started, whether we should be in time to save Gordon.
Lord Wolseley had announced before leaving England that we
should reach hand to Gordon about Christmas time; and that
this promise again, despite all the difficulties of the Nile, had been
exactly fulfilled by the dispatch of Stewart and the steamer expedition,
which, not by any fault of his, did not ‘reach hand’ the
few days earlier that were necessary to save Gordon. Others have
recalled how this exactness of calculation and prediction had
attended all his earlier campaigns. It is felt that now or never we
must settle the pretensions of Russia on India and in the East;
that if we did not take advantage of the rashness of Russia in
attacking us whilst she was engaged with Germany and Austria,
we could never again count upon the support of those allies. The
alliance with Italy is immensely popular. A few manly sentences
from Mr. Balfour in announcing his proposal to call out the volunteers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and one of the finest speeches which Mr. Chamberlain has
ever made in reply to a rather snappish little speech of Lord
Randolph, expressed the popular sentiment, and with general
consent on May 17th, the day before the Declaration of War
against Russia, the volunteers were called out.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_155.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>CALLING OUT THE VOLUNTEERS—PARADE OF THE SIGNALLERS OF THE ST. MARTIN’S LE GRAND CORPS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The response to the call has been very remarkable. It has,
of course, been necessary everywhere to make special arrangements
for the marshalling of the volunteers interfering as little as possible
with business. But, whereas with the militia, unfortunately, the
contrast between the peace effective and those who now show on
parade is melancholy, with the volunteers it is almost startling.
A few men have been with great reluctance, and probably only for
a time, obliged by business necessities to withdraw from the
ranks. Their places have been filled over and over again by
passed ‘efficients,’ who have returned to the battalions. But that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>is not all. The change that has come over the spirit of the men is
reported from all quarters. During quiet, peace times it was
very difficult to get any response from the volunteers if appeal
was made to them as representing the purpose of the British
people to take the defence of the country on their own shoulders.
Those did not understand the volunteers who so addressed them.
They were volunteers because they liked it, because others joined,
because they were good shots, and liked competing for the prizes,
because they liked the fun of skirmishing and outdoor practice
of all kinds, because it was a change from the sedentary habits of
ordinary life. But now that the nation is roused, when all men feel
that they would like, if they could, to play their part in the service
<em>of England</em> here, when Scotland does not intend to lag behind, and
when the blood of Irishmen is up, the talk is different. ‘What
other men want to do, <em>we</em> can’ is rather the feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the same time the contrast between different corps is certainly
a marked thing. The steady work of some, the indifference
of others now tells. No past ‘butter’ compensates for
present weakness. It is quite extraordinary what has been done
by some corps to prepare for present events. The Lord Mayor’s
subscription has greatly assisted the Metropolitan Corps to be
ready for the field. Generally, the town corps have had great
facilities for turning out promptly. The Government grant, which
has been defined already as payable on mobilisation, suffices to
provide most that is required. In the big towns, where some steps
have been taken beforehand to ascertain where waggons, carts,
horses, stores, could best be obtained, and where some of the
officers responsible knew just what was wanted and had it all
tabulated beforehand, the battalions and brigades have formed up
ready to move, so that they could live anywhere, with wonderful
rapidity.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the country districts, on the other hand, the differences
between different brigades is most marked. Many of them have
been telegraphing up to the Horse Guards to know where they are
to obtain this, that, and the other. The Horse Guards is overwhelmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>with work. Local knowledge is what is wanted. Here
and there officers have been sent down from London to assist the
more helpless corps; but few can be spared. The result in almost
all these cases is slow and unsatisfactory. On the other hand, from
some of the country brigades we hear the most encouraging reports.
It appears that a system has been worked out in certain
corps in accordance with suggestions thrown out in some articles
in the <cite>United Service Magazine</cite>. It has even been practised during
peace time. In accordance with this, first of all, long ago application
was made to certain owners of carts and horses to know
whether, in case of the volunteers being mobilised, they would be
ready to dispose of their property at a certain fixed price, and
whether they would undertake always to have a cart, for instance,
of that description ready. There has been found to be no practical
difficulty in making these arrangements beforehand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a set of printed papers of different colours has been
drawn out and kept in the Brigade office. These take a form of
this kind:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Private ——. On receiving by telegraph the word, “Mobilise,”
you will....’</p>

<p class='c011'>On the lists of names kept in the office those men who are
to fetch carts, horses, etc., are detailed. On the printed papers
prepared for these it is recorded, ‘You will at once go to No. X.
Y. Street, where you will find a horse with such and such harness
ready for you. You will take it to No. A. C. Street, where you will
find a cart ready for you. You will harness in the horse and proceed
to Mr. Jones’s, No. F. E. Street. There you will find Privates Blank
and Dash, who will have ready for you the stores to be loaded on
the cart, and will load them. As soon as the cart is loaded you
will drive to the rendezvous of the corps at Anywhere Park.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This will give an indication of the method which has been
pursued. The Government grant on mobilisation suffices to cover
the necessary expenses. The contrast between the rapidity with
which this system works and the confusion which exists where it
has not been adopted; the ease with which the whole thing is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>done, is, from all the accounts we have received, most striking.
Unfortunately, where no such preparation has been made the
delay and confusion which result are not the only evil effect. The
discouragement of the men from finding that they have not been
as well looked after as others, the want of confidence in their
officers, has a most demoralising effect. They hear that other
brigades have already marched to the great camps which are being
formed all over England, and they see that they have no prospect
of being ready for a long time. The praises which are daily
lavished on other corps for their extraordinary promptitude and
smartness are gall and wormwood to them. The women chaff them
mercilessly. It will not do to throw the blame on the ‘system’
or ‘the authorities,’ those convenient phrases which are commonly
employed to disguise the absence of a man. Others have managed
well enough under the present system and with the present
authorities. British self-help, guided by forethought and knowledge,
has been the secret.</p>

<p class='c011'>Certainly we have been fortunate in the passages which our
transports have made. It only shows what can be done under
favourable conditions of weather, with selected coal and selected
stokers. We understand that the Admiralty pressed on the
Government the importance of attending to these points in a
matter in which it might come to be a question of a run against
time across a danger zone. As we anticipated in writing our last
account of the events of the week, the Declaration of War by
France was issued after we had gone to press on Thursday, May
19th. It was therefore only barely in time that our great mass of
transports safely passed into the Levant. For, as will be seen
from the telegraphic report of our correspondent—received last
night, so that it has somewhat delayed our issue—the French Fleet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>has lost no time in following up the Declaration of War. The telegraphic
dispatch, which was sent off on the very evening of the
greatest naval engagement of modern times, explains clearly the
sequence of events which has for some time to come made the
Mediterranean once more a safe highway for us. We need not
dilate on the vast importance of this event. In the present case it
is not merely that our flag is once more supreme at sea; it means
that the terrible anxieties, which had been awakened in the public
mind as to the possible fate of our Eastern expedition, in case Sir
George Tryon should not secure a complete triumph, are now at
rest. With the Mediterranean secure it will be a very easy
matter to regain possession of the Black Sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whatever may be the ultimate purposes of the Italians in
regard to an Algerian expedition, we think that there will now be
no injury to the public service in letting it be known that the
preparations which were recently made with that apparent object
were only a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</span></i>. Of course, in order that they might
attain the object which they have so successfully achieved of
drawing the French Fleet out into the open sea, it was necessary
that these facts should be known only to Sir George Tryon. Our
correspondent, therefore, telegraphs under the impression which
prevailed in the fleet at the time. The rule is a sound one, even
in regard to fleets where they have communication with the land,
that what is believed among your own people will very soon be
believed by the enemy. But the Italian Government, as much as
our own, recognises the importance of the principle of concentrating
its efforts at one point at one time as far as that may be at all
possible. The Italians have quite enough on their hands in their
war by land and sea with France. Our efforts are already directed
to the East. All those most desirable objects, which the people
‘who know,’ or ‘have been there,’ or have been ‘ten years resident’
in various places, have been of late pressing upon the
Government through the newspapers, really must wait till we
have time, and armies, and fleets to attend to them. ‘One thing
at a time’ is a simple principle of military and naval affairs, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>it is one which the casual correspondents of newspapers never
keep before their minds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime we have received news of the great battle between
France and Germany, a report of which we have been expecting.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

    <div>THE ALLIED FLEET AT PORT MAHON.</div>
    <div class='c003'>(<em>From an Officer in Sir George Tryon’s Fleet.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I may begin the story of our great success by reminding your
readers that when the French violated the Belgian Frontier, and
we mobilised our fleet, Sir George Tryon had ten battleships with
him, while the French were supposed to have about eighteen
available for sea at Toulon, for they had withdrawn thither the
Mediterranean and Levant Squadrons simultaneously with their
demand upon Germany.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir George Tryon seems to have been very early informed that
if war arose the Home Government must depend greatly on the
alliance of Italy and Austria to maintain command of the Mediterranean
Sea, for a great naval force would be necessary in the North
to counteract the designs of Russia and France on the German
sea-coast. Sir George Tryon, on his part, talked quite openly—which
was said to be a wonder for him—of the fact that he was
not desirous of large reinforcements. He did not believe, he said,
that, if it came to the point, the French would bring out their
older wooden ships, such as the <em>Colbert</em>, the <em>Suffren</em>, or even
the <em>Richelieu</em>. The Italians, on the other hand, would most
probably be able to complete eight of their very fine ships, while
Austria might bring four or five vessels, which, though inferior,
would not be ineffective. As it turned out, Tryon was only
reinforced by two ships, the <em>Ajax</em> and the <em>Benbow</em>. Thus,
supposing the eight Italians could be brought into line, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>supposing the French produced eighteen ships, Tryon’s fleet
would be but two sail stronger than that of Admiral Rieunier.
As events developed themselves, it was plain that Sir George
grew anxious; but it was, both with himself and Admiral
Markham, the anxiety of eagerness, and we were all very well
assured that if it came to blows we should be daringly, as well as
efficiently, led.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the withdrawal of the fleet from the Black Sea, we were
all assembled at Malta, where the garrison was labouring night and
day in constructing out-works and exercising in the batteries.
For us, on the other hand, there was absolutely nothing to do,
except to keep our coals and stores complete day by day, which
was not a very arduous undertaking. There were, however, constant
and long conferences between the Admirals and the captains
of the battle-ships, and it was no secret that every one of these took
the form of discussions over possible or probable forms of attack
or defence by the fleet at sea. It came to be accepted that if we
met the French in open fight we should be numerically inferior,
and the question was, how we should act from that point of view?
The discussions amongst us, who were not directly responsible,
took every variety of form. Sometimes a hot party would arise,
claiming that it was perfectly useless to make plans until the
enemy disclosed his. This was met by another party declaring
that, if plans were not carefully made beforehand, there would
be no plans at all. This, again, was taken up by a third party,
which claimed that there was only one plan of any use, and
that was, as soon as the hostile fleet was seen, to make a general
signal, ‘Ram the enemy,’ and leave each ship to fight it out with
its fellow. When it was pointed out that perhaps the enemy
would not stay to be rammed, the general answer was, ‘Well, it is
all the same. There is nothing like the ram.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Two things made themselves clear in these arguments; first,
that hardly any one—even amongst the captains—had ever thought
seriously on what now seemed to be drawing so very close to us;
and, secondly, that the Admirals were beginning to lay down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>certain definite principles, which the captains were inclined to
accept as being very likely to turn out sound. Before very long
the whole result came out in a general order which was confidential
to the captains, the commanders, and the first-lieutenants
of the battle-ships.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without professing to give the exact wording, I am able to say
that the first principle laid down was the necessity of avoiding
giving a friend the ram, or firing into him either by gun or torpedo.
The second principle was the desirability of so arranging that, if
possible, an enemy’s ship should sustain the fire of more than one
of our own ships; or at least so guarding things that no one of our
ships should find herself opposed by two of the enemy’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>The memorandum went on to say that, as a consequence of
these principles, ships attached to one another were on no account
to separate unless forced to do so; but that if confusion arose,
ships were to keep their speed and pass out of the enemy’s fleet in
the direction opposite to that from which they passed into it, with
the view of reforming out of the smoke, in order to renew the
attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>In any case, said the order, the enemy will be approached by
the fleet in two or three columns in line ahead, at a speed of about
ten knots. The flag or senior officers will lead their columns, and
in whatever form the enemy may approach—if he does approach—they
will endeavour to cut through at different points, using their
guns, torpedoes, and rams indiscriminately as circumstances offer.
In order to avoid all chance of injuring friends, the columns will
be arranged in echelon. The Commander-in-Chief will lead the
first column, and the leaders of succeeding columns will not be
expected to enter the enemy’s fleet until the rear ships of the preceding
column may be supposed to have passed through. After
passing through, the ships not disabled will re-form and renew the
attack in the same way.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the enemy retires, making use of his stern guns, the fleet
will be formed in line abreast or quarter-line, and every endeavour
must be made to close with him, to ram his ships upon their sterns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>or quarters, or, in the event of failure, to carry them by boarding
from that position.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general opinion on this memorandum was that it said
quite enough, and yet not too much. It was quite clear and plain,
and nothing seemed wanting but the declaration of war and the
attack of a superior French Fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>We were very much surprised to hear from England that
troops were on their way out, with the idea of operations in the
Black Sea. It seemed very risky, when France might declare war
at any moment. But the general belief is that the Ministry must
have had some assurances from the French Government which we
know nothing about. Anyhow the transports began to arrive at
Malta in a continual stream, and there received orders to proceed
to Cyprus, where we hear preparations are being made for the
reception of the troops. The <em>Orient</em>, with the Duke of
Connaught on board, did not come in; she only closed sufficiently
to receive a signal changing her destination to Cyprus, and went
on. Several cruisers from the Channel appeared at intervals,
watching over the safety of the troopers; they were not interfered
with, and went on to Cyprus.</p>

<p class='c011'>News of the Spanish alliance and orders to proceed to Spezzia
to form a junction with the Italian Fleet came simultaneously, and
as the ships steamed out of the harbour the whole population
swarmed over the forts and walls and cheered in the wildest way,
which, on a signal from the Admiral, the ships returned heartily.
At Spezzia we found six ships ready, with orders from home to
watch Toulon, but not to make any attacks upon the French
unless they should attempt to attack Italy by sea. Simultaneously
with these orders we heard of the Duke of Edinburgh’s
wonderful and bloodless success in the North Sea. But there was
a general sound of congratulation that our force in the Mediterranean
was not powerful enough to compel such obedience as we
had enforced in the North. The Italians, ashore and afloat, were
in a wonderful state of enthusiasm. They crowded our ships
during the few days we lay at Spezzia, and the women were so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>demonstrative of affection that some of the older officers did not
half like it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It soon became known that Sir George Tryon had decided to
make Port Mahon the headquarters of the fleet, and to send
cruisers only before Toulon. I should have said that we were
now very fairly supplied in this way. They had been arriving
from England almost daily while we were at Malta, and we had
now fourteen, large and small, with the fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a reason which I did not at first understand, we only took
four out of the six Italian ships that were ready with us to Port
Mahon, namely, the <em>Andrea Doria</em>, the <em>Francisco Morosimi</em>,
the <em>Re Umberto</em>, and the <em>Rugiero di Lauria</em>. Moreover, we
left at Spezzia the <em>Thunderer</em>, <em>Ajax</em>, and <em>Agamemnon</em>. We
noted that the Italian ships we took with us were the newest, and
that those of our own we left were, in a sense, ‘lame ducks.’ But
still there was a good deal of wonder that we should deliberately
reduce our force to fourteen sail when we were almost closing with
the enemy. It was whispered about later that orders from home
had dictated the detachment, that war would be immediately
declared by England against France, and that an attack would be
made by Italian troops carried chiefly in the <em>Italia</em> and <em>Lepanto</em>,
and supported by a combined Anglo-Italian squadron against
Algiers.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, we steamed away to Port Mahon, and in this magnificent
harbour found a fresh relay of colliers and two more cruisers,
the <em>Apollo</em> and <em>Sappho</em>, which showed us that there was a good
deal of foresight at headquarters. We had the declaration of war
immediately, and then we began to see where we were. We were,
in fact, at bay. In no case was the French Fleet strong enough to
hope to prevent our putting to sea, and there was practically
nothing that France could do with her fleet, as long as ours was
intact. And now, too, I began to see that we were, at Minorca, in
a position to cover the proposed attack on Algiers. Any attempt
of the Toulon Fleet to drive off our attacking forces would be
liable to be met by a counter attack from ourselves. Yet if France
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>could really produce eighteen battleships out of Toulon, while we
could only furnish thirteen, we were running very great risks.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, we went to work in a very business-like way. Tryon
placed five of his largest cruisers, including the <em>Amphion</em>,
<em>Australia</em>, and <em>Undaunted</em>, on the line to Toulon, giving orders
that Lord Charles Beresford in the <em>Undaunted</em>, with Dunlop in
the <em>Australia</em> to back him up, were to undertake the watch on
the Toulon Fleet, closing with the harbour after dark, and drawing
off before daylight each morning, but not so far as to lose touch
with the port. Then the other three were to spread themselves
towards Minorca, and to work backwards and forwards, so as to
signal to each other and to Minorca at least once in every twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>For us at Port Mahon it again became a time of inaction;
nothing to do but exercise and keep our coal supply up. But we
now lay with fires banked and steam at half an hour’s notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>We soon learnt that the seven ships had left Spezzia with
several transports and cruisers; and we began to think that if
France had any chance at all, she might have it by falling suddenly
and swiftly on this weak detachment. The Admirals seemed sure
that she would, and the utmost anxiety attended the reports from
the signal station.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE BATTLE OF SARDINIA.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>THE RAMMING OF THE ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">AMIRAL BAUDIN</span>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was just after daylight on the morning of the fourth day
that a sort of cheering cry of ‘The enemy are at sea!’ ran all
through the ships. Up went the simple signal, ‘Weigh,’ and
there was really a horrible contrast between our anxiety and
eagerness and the unmoved grind and crunch as link by link the
cables came slowly in. But this was soon over, and we were at
sea, forming at once in two lines ahead, as before arranged. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>report was that the French had left Toulon twelve hours before,
steering about S.E., but it had not been possible to count their
numbers owing to the darkness. We steamed due east at half-speed;
but it was plain to us all that if the French passed through
the Straits of Bonifacio we might easily miss them, even though
our cruisers were well spread out both ahead and astern. While
we were in the middle of debate, down there rolled upon us as
dense a fog as ever I saw in the Mediterranean. The Admiral
had provided for this as for everything else, and we knew that we
must preserve order with the steam syrens only, without the aid
of guns; but as it was no use keeping speed, we slowed down.
We were like this all day and all night, and at daylight it seemed
as thick as ever. The ships had of course been all cleared for
action, and we were ready to open fire in a minute, though one
naturally prayed that the fog would lift before the enemy appeared.
At 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> it began to clear, and at 9 we distinctly counted
twenty-one steam-ships to the south of us. The flag-ship immediately
made the signal for eight knots, and gradually altered
course towards the strange fleet. We were soon able to make
them out as sixteen French battle-ships, in the indented line
abreast, steering south, with five cruisers in front of them. They
were smoking up a good deal, but at ten or twelve miles distance
we could not tell whether they were going at speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>We soon found they were not, for we began to gain on them,
and the signal was made for ten knots. We could tell by the
position of the steam cones, that every ship had steam to spare,
and I suppose it was the desire of making sure of a compact fleet
which kept us at comparatively low speed. Even at ten knots
we continued to gain considerably. We were quite two miles off
when the French began to open fire from their stern guns, and I
am bound to say we were all very much surprised at the bad
shots. They fell short and over, right and left, but after quite an
hour few ships apparently had been badly hit.</p>

<p class='c011'>We were still in two lines ahead and were making no reply at
all to the French fire. We could not understand, when we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>got within 3000 yards, why the Admiral did not put us in line
abreast and open fire. But in the middle of our wonder we
suddenly saw the French ships open out to right and left, and
before we knew where we were the whole mass of the battle-ships
were coming right down upon us. We saw at once that it was in
anticipation of some such manœuvre that we had not quitted our
first formation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the wisdom of our Admirals was at once shown. Orders
were given to train the guns abeam and to let the enemy have it
at the closest range, abstaining from fire till then. The French,
on the other hand, never ceased to fire; but the smoke they made
so surrounded them that it was plain they were wasting their
ammunition, and did not see so well where they were going. But
their rapidity of approach was tremendous, and I could note it as I
had no guns to look after and could see nearly all round from the
sheltered spot I had chosen.</p>

<p class='c011'>My ship was near the middle of the port line, and I soon saw
the great jet of smoke from the <em>Trafalgar</em>, followed by the roar
which denoted the simultaneous discharge of a whole broadside.
In less than half a minute there was the puff and the roar of the
second ship, the <em>Collingwood</em>, and almost immediately I saw that
the <em>Nile</em>, at the head of the other line, had fired. But then I
directly saw what I had not been prepared for. I saw the <em>Nile</em>
turning round sharp to port, and, looking to the head of my own
line, I saw the <em>Trafalgar</em> steaming along our line on the opposite
course to ours. It flashed through my mind like a shot, that
every ship was turning round after she had fired her broadside,
and that consequently the heads of the French lines or groups,
after running the gauntlet of our lines, would be met by the ships
that had first fired on them, and that as the battle had begun by
the ships passing in opposite directions, it would be continued by
all the ships with their heads in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not pretend to say that I knew what all this meant at
the moment; indeed, I did not know anything in another minute,
for the roar and shake of the whole of our guns, trained on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>port beam, knocked the power of thinking out of me. Recovering
myself in a cloud of choking smoke, I was first aware that there
must have been very little reply to our fire, but two signalmen
were stretched on the deck beside me, both quite still; one with
his shoulder torn entirely away, and the other bleeding profusely
from a wound in his head. There were also, as if through the
ship, new sorts of voices which, in hurried and confused utterance,
warned me that there were death and wounds elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was no time to think of it. We were wheeling
round after our next ahead; and out of the dense smoke which
we were leaving, issued stray missiles tearing past, and sometimes
striking davits or stanchions, or shattering the planking of a boat.
There was nothing, in fact, now but a roar of guns all round us,
and we were covered with a canopy of smoke. The sole design perceptible
was that we were only firing into the smoke to starboard,
and no missiles were coming from the port side, while every now
and then we got a glimpse of our next ahead and next astern.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we steamed on, messages went from the captain to the
lieutenants not to fire any more till they could see the enemy;
and it was becoming clear that the French fire was ceasing,
though whereabouts they were could hardly be ascertained.
Presently, however, we found ourselves quite clear of smoke and
could see then that the French ships must, most of them, have
stopped, for our vessels—as well as could be seen—were nearly
in their old formations, while the French were well astern, still
somewhat entangled by the smoke, and evidently in some confusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Out of this smoke there quickly emerged a ship, which we
made out to be the flag-ship <em>Formidable</em> with a considerable
heel to port and steering to the N.W.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the general signal flying that the Division was to continue
its course, the <em>Trafalgar</em> suddenly put on steam and went
after the <em>Formidable</em> full speed. The two ships were now in
close action and enveloped in smoke, so that we could only make
out their positions occasionally, the <em>Trafalgar</em> apparently hanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>on the starboard quarter of the <em>Formidable</em>. The firing did
not last more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, when, the
smoke clearing away, it was seen that the <em>Formidable’s</em> colours
were down.</p>

<p class='c011'>What had happened we only knew afterwards. The <em>Formidable</em>
had been badly torpedoed in passing, and was steaming as
she hoped out of action when we saw her. As the <em>Trafalgar</em>
approached, she made a short gallant defence with her guns, and
fired two torpedoes at her; but the water was rising in the stoke-holds,
and it was impossible to keep steam. Admiral Markham,
seeing plainly what the case was, passed close under the <em>Formidable’s</em>
stern, and hailed to claim surrender in the interests of
humanity, or he would ram and sink her. It was the chance of
war, and there was nothing but surrender before our gallant
opponent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime it was plain to be seen how well Sir George Tryon’s
orders had worked. Some of our ships were frightfully knocked
about, and the <em>Benbow</em> was almost in a sinking state from a
number of shot-holes between wind and water; while the <em>Edinburgh</em>
was all down by the head, having caught a torpedo near
the stem, but the whole of the ships were in two lines as they
entered into action, and they now re-formed and headed towards
the French, leaving the <em>Benbow</em>, <em>Edinburgh</em>, and the prize French
flag-ship together, attended by two or three of the cruisers.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the most frightful incident of the battle took place in
the other line, and I was not an eye-witness of it. I have not
mentioned the <em>Polyphemus</em> before, but she was with us and
sailed with us. It seems Sir George Tryon’s orders to her were
simply to keep out of the way in the first instance, and to strike
home should any opportunity offer. Captain Brooke, it appears,
running out to starboard of the Admiral’s column, saw his chance
in the smoke, and ran straight at the nearest French ship, whose
attention was taken up by the fire of our ships on her other side.
The shock was horrible, and she scarce had time to extricate herself,
when the <em>Amiral Baudin</em> reeled and sank.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>FLIGHT OF THE FRENCH SQUADRON.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It did not appear that the rest of the French ships were as
much knocked about as we were, but we afterwards learnt the
cause of this. It was simply that the heavy shell of the French
had made a greater show on us during our first approach than
we had been aware of; but, in passing, our light guns had made
terrible havoc amongst the unprotected guns’ crews in the
French batteries, while, as they had not reserved their fire, it was
not so destructive to us. Then, too, it seems that our manœuvre
was entirely unexpected, and paralysed the action of the leading
ships after they had, as they supposed, passed through our fleet.
It was, again, our light guns which produced effect, but without
making it so visible to outside observers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The loss of the flag-ship, of the <em>Amiral Baudin</em>, and the great
loss in killed and wounded did, however, act in demoralising the
ships’ companies, so that three or four of the ships had already
drawn off to the north-eastward, and there was for the time a good
deal of confusion; but they turned their heads from us and gradually
drew out into a line abreast, nearly as we met them at first.</p>

<p class='c011'>No doubt fearing a repetition of their former manœuvre, Sir
George Tryon kept his fleet still in two lines; but as the French
swept round, steering first N.E. and then nearly due north for
Toulon, we were broken up into four short columns, and these
were presently put into quarter line.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now we had a game of long bowls for some time, without
apparently much damage to either side. We were always being
checked in our pursuit by the failure first of one ship, and then
of another, to keep steam; and it seemed to be precisely the same
with the French, so that darkness closed upon us without either
the French being able to draw out of action, or our being able to
make it a close one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before daylight, our reckoning brought us so close up to
Toulon, that, as we had lost sight of the enemy three hours before,
signal was made to slow down, and at daylight we could just
make out the French closing into the land and disappearing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Such was the Battle of Sardinia, as I made it out. The French
risked it in the hope of falling on the weak Anglo-Italian
squadron, and so saving Algeria. It was almost as great a risk
for us, being so numerically inferior; but, accepting the position
all along, our Admirals so managed that we suffered much less
loss in the end. But the feature which struck us all as most
remarkable was the fact that while we had two ships practically
disabled, and the French had suffered but the same loss, yet we
were victorious by reason of the terrible carnage which our lighter
guns had caused in the enemy’s ships.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>P.S.</em>—I have just learnt that the real cause of the French
retreat was news that reached them by a cruiser of the approach
of the squadron from Algiers. This Sir George Tryon expected
all along, but we knew nothing of it. We met the ships next
day. News from England has just come by the <em>Blonde</em>. The
German Fleet has joined that of Sir Michael Seymour in the Gulf
of Finland, and he has sent home five of his ships. The Duke
of Edinburgh has detached two of his, and the whole seven are
making the best of their way, with several cruisers, to reinforce
us. All idea of further attack on Algiers is given up, and
Admiral Markham will sail with ten battle-ships and six cruisers
to the Levant, to convoy the troops into the Black Sea, and then to
mask the Russian Fleet in Sebastopol. So the Black Sea expedition
is to go on. Yet the general opinion amongst us is that our
Government are running considerable risks, and that we are
relying on the principle of ‘Nothing venture, nothing have.’</p>

<p class='c011'>There has been a smart cavalry action to-day in the vicinity
of Ligny and St. Amand, names so well known in the Waterloo
campaign, in which the French have very decidedly had the worst
of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before commencing my account, I will add that the censorship
here is very strict indeed, and that no mention whatever is permitted
of numbers of corps or regiments, or of the names of their
commanders; as these data are invaluable to an enemy in enabling
him to check the truth of information received, and it is always
possible that the wires between here and Brussels may be tapped.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yesterday afternoon I found a place in a train going to Gembloux,
where our Cavalry Division had arrived during the morning.
Arrived there, I met an old friend in the Hussars, who told me
that he and three other officers had been selected for a reconnaissance
ride next morning, and that a place in their carriage was at
my service. The idea of driving out to a real cavalry action struck
me as singular, so I asked for information, and was told by my
friend that he and his comrades, who were all noted steeplechase
riders, had had several horses in training for a meeting, to which
the war had put a stop, and had been told by their colonel to train
the horses a little ‘fat’ and bring them along to the front—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>would be glad of their services, and find them an opportunity for
distinction greater than any to be won between the flags. They
were to have their horses led out for them, and, as soon as the
expected collision occurred, to mount, slip through the enemy’s
scouts in the confusion of the scrimmage, and ride as far as possible
to the south and westward to see what was going on behind
the cavalry screen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Needless to say, I accepted the offer, and 2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> found me with
my friends driving out along the road to Ligny, where lay the outposts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Latest reports indicated the enemy’s cavalry, at least a division
strong, between Fleurus and Charleroi. The advance-guard of our
Division, the Hussar brigade, moved off about an hour before sunrise,
following the line of the great road. We stayed behind to
await the arrival of the main body, and presently moved over in
the direction of St. Amand. Soon the main body was seen
approaching, and about the same time we could see the Hussars
falling back across the railway, and a report arrived that the
French were coming on in force.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Divisional Commander rode forward to reconnoitre the
ground in front, and left orders to the main body to form for attack
under cover in a hollow in rear; the same, by chance, in which
Blücher had stationed the reserves of his right before the battle of
Ligny in 1815.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a perfectly faultless morning, and the sun was just
beginning to rise when we saw three batteries of French Horse
Artillery cross the railway and come out into the plain. Our own
batteries were in the act of unlimbering, at double intervals, to
allow for the melinite shells; and as they crossed the sky-line the
French, too, saw them, and came into ‘action front.’ The two
first shots on each side fell almost simultaneously, and the duel
began. The hollow in our front and the blinding rays of the sun
full in the eyes of the enemy gave us an immense advantage, and
in five minutes our side had ‘ranged,’ and one French gun was
sent flying. Meanwhile our Hussars had been falling back, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>were wheeling up into position as second and third lines to the
two heavy brigades.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French Cavalry were now crossing the railway in line of
squadron columns and immediately afterwards formed ‘line,’ and
the signal to advance was given by our Commander. As our horse
crossed the plateau on which the guns were in action, ‘Troops half
left’ was sounded, and the French hearing the signal, no doubt,
and seeing also that we were not quite in line, must have guessed
our intention to attack their left, and endeavoured to meet it by
‘Shouldering.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Reaching the hollow our cavalry again wheeled into line, crossed
the little brooklet without disorder, and then, by silent signal,
broke into column of troops to the right, and galloped up the
hollow in a long sweeping stride—their distances perfectly preserved.
This movement promised to bring them out right on the
flank and rear of the French left, but the next moment we saw the
French Reserve, which had hitherto been hidden by trees along the
lane from Perwin to Bry—moving in a direction that would bring
them right on the flank of our first line. The situation was most
critical—we all held our breath—but the next moment we heard
the regimental call of the leading regiment, followed by the long
‘G’s’ of ‘line to the front,’ and we knew that the danger was seen
and met.</p>

<p class='c011'>Simultaneously also the tail of the column still in sight wheeled
into line, and came dashing forward to the attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French were already in a poor condition to meet it. The
attempt to ‘shoulder’ the long line had loosened their order, and
from the moment they came in sight our gunners had turned their
full power upon them with results almost indescribable. Out of
the dust and smoke of the bursting shells we saw limbs and bodies
thrown high in the air, and the right and second line of the enemy
was already in hopeless confusion before the blow fell on their
left. This wing had escaped our shells, for to fire on it would
have imperilled our own men. They saw the danger coming, and
two squadrons endeavoured to wheel up to meet it, but they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>too late, the next moment our trumpets rang out the ‘charge,’ and
with a roar of cheering our men dashed forward; we heard the
crash of the collision, for a moment saw horses rear up and fall
backward, and then the dust rose and shut out all further vision.
But the French did not bolt, the wreck of their right and second
line wheeled up, rallied on their officers as best they could, and
dashed into the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>, where they too were lost to sight. From
time to time we saw groups of our white-coated Cuirassiers and
the dark blue Uhlans emerge from the dust-cloud, then wheel and
go back again, and for some moments the fight here became
stationary, for the French on this point outnumbered us two to
one. Then suddenly from out of the hollow we again heard the
charge sounding, and for a second or two caught sight of the left
of our third line, as with perfectly closed ranks they dashed into
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>. This blow settled the matter. The mass again came
into motion; first a few files, followed by more, began to drop off
to the rear, and presently the whole cloud, gathering pace as it
went, swept down right on to the flank of their horse batteries,
who, seeing the danger coming, had endeavoured to limber up in
the full fire of our artillery. But they were too late, the crowd
swept over them, and when it had passed we saw eight guns still
on the ground, with some Hussars and Uhlans busy around them.</p>

<p class='c011'>What happened on our right I could only partially see, the
trees interfering with my line of vision. I am therefore dependent
on the testimony of others.</p>

<p class='c011'>The regiment that had ‘front formed’ was one of the heaviest
in the army, and prided itself on riding even closer knee to knee in
the charge than the regulation sanctions; and well was it for them
that they did so, for the odds against them were very heavy.
The shock was perfectly direct; the French wavered a little at the
last moment, and the Cuirassiers burst through them, maintaining
their formation almost intact; then, wheeling round, attacked the
overlapping French squadrons, and drove them back towards the
hollow, where the second line of Hussars, warned of what was
happening in front, had taken ground outwards, and then charged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> from the northwards, setting it in motion again towards
the south.</p>

<p class='c011'>By degrees the forces began to disentangle themselves, and the
Germans rallied again in closed squadrons, while the French got
away as best they could towards the woods of Lambusart.</p>

<p class='c011'>The losses due to the lance appear to have been trifling, for at
the moment of actual contact the men could not reach each other;
the horses fairly breasted one another, and the lighter ones went
over backwards, many being found with fractured spines. In the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i>, too, the lance proved useless,—the crowd was too dense.
Men wrestled and fought with their fists. The French loss caused
by our artillery was perfectly appalling; but, thanks to the dexterity
of our leader, who managed always to keep the enemy
between him and the guns—thus effectually masking their fire—we
have escaped their shells almost entirely. I may also call
attention to the advantages we secured by having the sun at our
backs, which gave the French gunners—excellently trained as they
are, and gallant beyond a doubt—hardly the chance of inflicting
injury on us.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one can accuse the French this morning of showing anything
but perfect gallantry, but we have again an instance that
more than gallantry is required for cavalry efficiency. The reason
why the Germans won is because they manœuvred with perfect
precision, and were so thoroughly in hand that even the most unexpected
occurrences could be met and dealt with. Here the
French were outmatched, and their leader, too, seemed hardly equal
to his task. He formed line too soon; had he stayed in squadron
columns a little longer he could have changed front without the
unsteadiness entailed by the endeavour to do so after the line had
been formed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whilst writing this one of the General Staff has kindly come
round to tell me that there is room in a special train starting to-night
in two hours—destination not to be breathed—and I fancy
within a very short time you will hear of something startling;
more I dare not say at present.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>My friends of this morning are back again safe and sound,
having ridden some sixty miles. They tell me the French had
thirty-six squadrons against our twenty-four this morning. But
about the rest of their information I must be silent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The curtain has at last fallen on the first act of this great
national tragedy—the first strategical problem has been solved,
and I am again free to write.</p>

<p class='c011'>Briefly what has happened is this:</p>

<p class='c011'>All the available troops of the Metz (or 3d Army) have been
drawn off under cover of the operations described in my telegram
of the 5th inst., to the neighbourhood of Luxembourg—Thionville.</p>

<p class='c011'>The five Corps of the 1st Army have been concentrated from
Namur, and districts northward, behind the frontier north of
Mezieres, Sedan, and the 2d Army (four Corps) has formed between
them. Three other Corps are following in rear.</p>

<p class='c011'>These movements were completed on the 9th inst., and at daybreak
on the 10th the frontier was crossed by the leading troops
of all three armies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two French corps, distributed for the defence of the Meuse,
were caught by the 3d Army whilst endeavouring to concentrate,
and compelled to fall back in considerable confusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Second Army met with no opposition, and their cavalry
reached Buzancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cavalry divisions in advance of the First Army had a sharp
and victorious encounter with French horse on the plateau between
the Meuse and Aisne, who retreated afterwards towards Laon, and
our leading corps made good the passage of the Meuse, between
Mezieres and Sedan, and upstream towards Mouzon, their advance
guards bivouacking on the line, Rancourt—Omont—Poix. It was
a day of hard marching, but the weather was cool, and the men in
good training seemed to make light of their twenty to twenty-five
miles.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>I was not present at any of the collisions this day, being unable
to overtake the cavalry screen; from what I can learn, however,
the success of the latter was due to much the same reasons
as in the fight at St. Amand—Bry, viz., mobility in the troops,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</span></i> in the leaders, and closed files in the charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fight of the next day I saw capitally, and send it herewith
as I wrote it the same evening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ENGAGEMENT AT VAUX CHAMPAGNE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-r c003'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Dricourt</span>, <em>May 11</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I overtook the main body of our Cavalry Division (<em>i.e.</em> the one
attached to the immediately following Corps, with which I have
for the present joined fortunes) near Tourteron—a village lying
some seven miles north of the Aisne—late last night, and learnt
that there was certain to be a sharp tussle next morning; for patrols
reported large masses of French troops in the valley of the Aisne
about Vouziers, and from a neighbouring hill we could see the
reflection of their bivouac fires, while southward we heard the noise
of trains passing constantly and at short intervals on the line
from Rheims to Monthois.</p>

<p class='c011'>At 3 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the headquarter orders reached us, and at 4.30 we
were on the move—pretty smart work, considering the number of
hands through which orders had to pass. I followed the General’s
staff, who had kindly given me permission to do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our mission was evident, viz., to seize the high land beyond
the Aisne, to cover the passage of the stream by our infantry.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the way reports came in that a large body of French troops,
at least a Corps, was moving to meet us by the same road, and it
became evident that it was a race between us who could reach the
long stretching downs of Vaux Champagne in our front first, and
in sufficient strength to hold them. That our cavalry could be
there in time was clear; indeed, our scouts were already far beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>it, but how to hold it was another matter, about which I should
have liked information, but did not dare to ask for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cantered forward, and drew up on the downs about 7.15.
I found the situation very much like one I saw at the French
manœuvres last year near Lesmont, when infantry and artillery,
both without scouts in advance, raced for a similar hill, and met at
the top with results disastrous for the artillery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ground was exactly similar, and deserves a word or two of
explanation. The downs of Vaux form, as it were, a <span class='fixed'>T</span> piece to a
long central ridge. We were standing on the cross-head, and
looking southward a corresponding transverse ridge limited our
vision at 2500 to 3000 yards, and between the two lay two valleys
trending east and west from the central neck, the slopes gentle and
unbroken, with a slight convexity in cross section. If we were
ten minutes too late the infantry would be in the hollows out of
the line of sight of our batteries, and our fate would be a matter
of minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>We had only three batteries on the spot, and where were the
others? I did not know, and dared not ask, and as etiquette prevented
my going in front of the General, I had not the consolation
of studying his face; all I noticed was that he was smoking very
quietly and reflectively. Northward, a mist lay over the river,
and all the valley was still; the minutes seemed like hours. At
length my ear caught the sound, so well known to me, of the roll
of gun-carriages and clatter of harness, and out of the sea of mist
below I suddenly saw the helmets and heads of the gunners arise,
and then I knew that, confident in the reports of the cavalry, our
General was going to try, and to succeed, in the same manœuvre
in which the French last year, without cavalry, had so conspicuously
failed; for these new comers could only be the Corps Artillery,
and with eighteen to twenty batteries in line on this height in
time, I felt certain no infantry could hope to capture it. The
enemy, however, was not far off, for isolated shots were now heard
from the southward, and our cavalry videttes came in view, falling
back before his advance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Our guns were brought up behind the brow and unlimbered,
but kept back below the sky-line, and every one was ordered under
cover, where we waited for some ten minutes. Then suddenly
the order was given to load and run forward by hand. I crept to
the front and there saw extending half-way down the opposite slope
the leading lines of a whole French Division deployed for action. A
more perfect target it would have been impossible to devise. Next
moment eighteen batteries at least were pouring their fire into
this defenceless mass, and the further hillside became a scene of
slaughter unequalled in the annals of warfare except, possibly, at
Eylau.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>OUR CORRESPONDENT AT THE BATTLE OF VAUX CHAMPAGNE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The guns were all laid for the leading line, there was no
question of ranging at all—for the distance was not more than 1200
yards—some of the French threw themselves down and attempted
to reply, but in a few moments the smoke and dust from our
bursting shells enveloped them, and their bullets began to fly
higher. The following lines pressed on to the leading ones, thus
making the target denser, and now the gunners changed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>shrapnel to common shell, with high explosive bursters, and we
saw limbs and trunks of men thrown high in the air above the
dust-clouds, whilst even the screams of the wounded reached us
above the din. It was ghastly beyond the power of description,
and I dropped back to look the other way, and there saw the whole
of our Cavalry Division trotting forward to reap the harvest the
guns had sown.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were at this moment in column of regiments, each
regiment wheeled up by troops, and moving perpendicularly to
the prolongation of the enemy’s line. I lost sight of them for
a moment as I cut across the hill, and when I next saw them
they had wheeled into line and were bearing down on the enemy
obliquely across his front, so that six successive lines were available
to ride down all resistance. The first two lines increased
their squadron intervals, and opened their files to about half a
horse’s length, and then, at about 500 yards from the enemy, the
gallop was sounded. The outer sections of the French endeavoured
to wheel up to meet them, but a last salvo from the two flank batteries
with shrapnel seemed to tear them away, and the next
instant the cavalry were on them. For a moment the line was a
bit unsteadied, but its pace did not check. The French rose and
fired after them, and many fell, but the second line, 300 yards in
rear of the first, was on them, and then the third and fourth, and
now I understood why the German cavalry carry lances. The
first line kept up its pace to the end, and then rallied beyond it
and came back through them again; the fifth, not yet engaged,
trotted round and charged in from the front, and the sixth moved
off up the hill to watch the flanks. The confusion now defied
description, the French firing like lunatics in every direction, and
the whole mass taking an uphill direction, thus masking the fire
of the French guns, which had been in action within a few minutes
of the commencement of our fire, and had replied pluckily to the
guns on our side specially reserved to deal with them; but now,
in the confusion, our lancers got amongst them and succeeded in
destroying most of the teams. It was 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> when the first gun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>fired, it was 8.20 when the cavalry charged, and since then, perhaps,
twenty minutes more had elapsed—a whole Infantry Division had
been destroyed. But our position was by no means without cause
for anxiety, nor could we hold the ground we had won; we knew
French reinforcements were at hand, for we heard guns open on
our cavalry beyond the hill, and these soon began falling back in
disorder.</p>

<p class='c011'>What would we not have given for a brigade of Bersaglieri or
of French Chasseurs—I thought of one I had seen last autumn
that marched nine kilometres in forty-five minutes, and wished
we had it with us now.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our leading companies were still a couple of miles away;
heading more to the left, I moved along the ridge till I reached a
point whence I could overlook what was going to happen.</p>

<p class='c011'>About two miles to the south-east I saw a French brigade with
six batteries of artillery, moving forward, formed for attack in their
conventional manner. The guns came into action to the eastward,
and almost at the same moment the Prussian divisional batteries
also unlimbered, but the French found their range first, and so
occupied the attention of the Germans that the infantry this time
passed unscathed down the same slope which, on the other flank,
had proved so disastrous to them. It was now evident, from the
form of the ground, that the two infantries would butt up against
each other at about two hundred yards, and victory would probably
fall to the side which was quickest ‘on the drop,’ as the
Americans say. Both sides were rapidly approaching one another,
the Prussians still in line of company columns, the French in a
dense line of skirmishers. Presently the former ‘front formed
line,’ their drums began to beat, and the whole advanced in
‘parade march,’ dressed as on the passing line. Suddenly, and
simultaneously, the French line dropped to the ground, the Prussians
halted and came to the ready; for a moment they stood
motionless. Then the French, finding, I suppose, that on the
ground, they could not see, sprang to their feet, and that instant
there was a glint of light along the line as the rifles came to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>present, and the next second the scythe of death swept over the
French, and they fell in swathes. But the Prussians began to fall
too, and the French supports were closer at hand, and fed the
fighting line more rapidly, but their fire was not equally in hand.
I could hear the Prussian volleys and mark the course of each
distinctly. For five minutes the struggle raged—the roar of musketry
was deafening—but above it I again caught the beat of the
drum, and saw the second Prussian line advancing. When it was
almost close on the first, the shrill whistles sounded, the fire
partially ceased, and, headed by their officers, the whole sprang
forward with a rush. But the French did not give; their reserves,
too, were close at hand in company columns; the fighting line
rallied on these, and all dashed forward together. But no bayonet
encounter followed. Both sides halted at about thirty paces, and
again the magazine fire blazed out, telling on the French clumps
much more rapidly than it did on the Prussian line—for a single
bullet pierced ten or a dozen bodies. Then presently the French
masses became ragged towards the rear—they bagged outwards
like sacks, and began to move with increasing speed down the hill,
and at this moment two squadrons of divisional cavalry, who had
slipped out between the guns and the infantry, swept down on
them from flank to flank.</p>

<p class='c011'>They probably did not do much damage, but they separated
the infantries—and a number of French batteries now appeared
on the further hill, and compelled the Prussians to fall back also.</p>

<p class='c011'>The artillery duel now began again—but lasted only a short
time, for the French evidently only meant to break off the fight,
and as soon as the wreck of the infantry were in safety, the firing
ceased, and the guns withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Germans were in no condition for immediate pursuit.
They had to wait for the remainder of the corps to close up, and
to rally the cavalry.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now about 11.30—and to the eastward on the high ground
overlooking the Aisne about Vouziers we could see the flashes of
a long line of guns, and in the plain below dark masses of troops.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>About four we moved forward, and about six bivouacked near
a place called Dricourt, whence I write this. I learn that our
scouts discovered a whole Corps moving down on our flank this
morning from St. Remy, but about 10 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, hearing presumably of
the result of the action at Vaux, they bent off southward, and are
evidently now on our front. It appears the French Corps we
fought to-day came on with one division deployed for action on its
left, a brigade in echelon on the right. The corps artillery between
the two and the remaining brigade in reserve. Where the cavalry
was we do not know.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another French corps was defeated about Vouziers. So we
have the wreck of two Corps, and the whole of one for certain, in
our front for to-morrow, for our outposts are in contact along the
whole line. How many more we may find I cannot tell, but we
are two days clear ahead of their calculated mobilisation, and these
two days’ fighting must have seriously deranged their plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men are rather sober; they have seen death for the first
time, and the slaughter caused by our new shells is most horrible
to look at. Besides, only few of them were engaged in the actual
fighting line, and the remainder do not yet know from experience
the intensity of the passion for blood which seizes them when once
they have taken active part in the slaying.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been a wise measure to let the massed bands play
to-night, and I have never experienced anything more moving
than the sound of the last great hymn, sung by all the men, with
which the ‘Zapfenstreich’ winds up.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gunners were moving long before daylight, and I went
with them. Dawn was just breaking when we reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>summit of the rolling ridge which marks our front, and we could
still see signs of bivouac fires burnt low on another and almost
parallel wave some 2000 to 3000 yards to our front. The bottom
of the hollow is steeper and we cannot see into it, but they tell
me our Infantry are down there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our position faces N.N.W. by S.S.E., so again we shall have
the sun at our backs. Some of our guns are entrenched, and I
notice the intervals between them are wider than usual, probably,
as before, to ward against the melinite shells.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of our strategic position all I know is that we have a Corps on
either flank, and two within supporting distance—what the 2d

<p class='c011'>I was obliged to break off my dispatch abruptly, owing to the
sudden development of events. I had just written the last line
when the first gun went off about ten minutes before sunrise, and
for an hour an incessant roar of artillery raged. The French shot
well, but the sun in their eyes gave them never a chance.</p>

<p class='c011'>I had now time and daylight enough to look round. Our
troops were all carefully under cover at least 2000 yards to the
rear, mostly in rendezvous formations, waiting. Of the enemy I
could only see his guns, and when the sun rose high enough, one
could distinctly make out the line of an entrenchment just at the
break of the long slope into the hollow. Even then I might not
have noticed it but for the indiscretion of its occupants, who
would keep moving about. It may have been about six o’clock
when I saw, out of the hollows away to the rear, three great
columns rise up, which proved to be six batteries of Artillery each.
They trotted forward, forming line to the front, and then I realised
that I was at length about to see a real Napoleonic battle, the
blow to pierce the centre or fail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearing the outer edge of the zone, where the splinters of
bursting shells meant for us began to be dangerous, the gallop was
sounded, and the whole eighteen batteries dashed forward in
superb form. Our guns increased their fire to the utmost extremity,
shrouding the enemy’s front in the smoke of their shells,
and then ceased for a few moments as the new arrivals passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>through the intervals, resuming it again as soon as they were
clear, and maintaining it at this extreme rate till it was seen that
the others had unlimbered and were ready to take their part in
the action at a range of about 1500 yards. This move brought
them, however, to within 1000 yards of the enemy’s advanced
Infantry, and we saw many drop; but our own advanced posts
had been reinforced by small driblets, too insignificant to attract
the enemy’s artillery fire, and these with the aid of a few guns
that could now be spared soon took the edge off the French
Infantry fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>In fifteen minutes or less, the effect of these eighteen fresh
batteries was plainly apparent; to stay where they were meant
for the French gunners annihilation, and that was not their business,
and presently we saw their teams come up by alternate
batteries. In the crowd of men and horse thus assembled our
shells made terrible havoc, and probably not one-third of the guns
were successfully withdrawn. Then the whole power of our
sixty batteries was turned on the Infantry, and we had the
‘defender’s dilemma’ before us. He could not retire his Infantry
up the slope, for that meant beginning the action with a retreat;
and he could not leave them there unsupported, for that would
mean annihilation; his only chance was to move troops down the
slope to reinforce them—and presently we saw them coming.
Then a repetition of yesterday’s slaughter began.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had we known for certain what was going on out of our sight,
we might have been content to let the foe bleed himself to death
in these fruitless efforts; but we did not, we could only guess that
he would be moving forward his reinforcements of all arms with
all haste, and our game was to crush what was before us as
quickly as might be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our Infantry were now rapidly coming up, the two divisions
side by side, the brigades of each in the same order, with their
regiments each one behind the other. The leading regiment had
two battalions in first line and one in support, and the foremost
battalions, each two companies in front and two behind, in company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>column. As the troops approached our guns they formed
line and came forward, their drums beating, with the strictest
possible discipline, for the bullets were flying in showers overhead,
and men were constantly dropping.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lines went down the slope with about 500 paces between
them, and as the leading one reached the advanced posts, the latter
rose, and, with a cheer, dashed down into the hollow, where they
found shelter for a moment in the dead angle at the foot of the
slope. Our gunners now turned their fire on the Infantry trench
for a few moments with high explosive shells, and then the whole
crowd of men in the hollow rose and rushed it at the point of the
bayonet, clearing it in a moment and pursuing beyond. Then
came the turn of the French, and gallantly they availed themselves
of it. Our rapid advance had masked our guns, the French
falling back before it had been taken up by their supports, and
now having only Infantry to deal with, the whole of them turned
and came on again.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not come to cold steel, however, for again both sides
stopped and blazed into each other with magazine fire and
astounding inaccuracy. The air above our heads seemed alive
with bullets—but our reserves were coming up under cover, and
those of the French moving down hill caught many of the missiles
that flew too high. Soon, perhaps in five minutes, the whole body,
both assailants and defenders, began to move slowly up the hill,
the movement never ceasing till our Infantry reached the top.
Our Horse Artillery, followed by our Divisional Cavalry, galloped
forward in support. What happened for the next few minutes I
am unable to state from observation, for I, too, was moving across
the valley, and looking for a reasonably secure spot from which to
see further. I found one at the junction between two French
Corps, where a copse came right up to the edge of their line—both
Corps being hotly engaged in front had wheeled inwards a little
towards the centre, and there was a gap of some 500 yards, and
not a soul on the look-out. From here I could take in the whole
situation. To the south-eastward guns flashing and heavy masses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>of troops showed the battle extended for miles beyond the left of
our corps, and south-west of us I saw at least thirty French
batteries in line along a low crest that ran about parallel to the
ridge we had now reached, whilst up the slope towards us, but
from our left front, a whole French Division of Infantry was
moving towards their comrades on the hill already hardly pressed,
from whom they were yet about one thousand yards distant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their guns were still silent, for their Infantry masked their
view, and it was fortunate for our battalions that they were so,
for the fight for the moment was stationary, and we were only just
holding our own.</p>

<p class='c011'>For some moments it continued so, and the effect to the
spectator was very curious. The air was so filled with the roar of
musketry that it seemed to come from nowhere in particular.
There was nothing, in the absence of all smoke, to connect it with
these two long lines of men, whose rifles spasmodically rose and
fell. Along the front of the French, owing, I suppose, to the
angle at which I saw them, a row of little blue sparks scintillated
like the spark discharge from an electric brush, and over both
there lay a blue-grey mist which gave a curious mirage effect to
the whole. The shooting must have been vile on both sides, for
according to practice-ground results, thirty seconds should have
sufficed for mutual extermination; but, though men fell fast, the
net result appeared wonderfully small.</p>

<p class='c011'>This may have lasted some three minutes, but it was impossible
to keep the run of the time, and then above the roll of the
musketry I caught the beat of the drums, and a reinforcing line,
closed and in perfect order, came over the brow to our assistance.
The sight of these closed lines was enough for both sides; the
French gave way, and our fighting line dashed forward. But only
for some 300 yards or so, for again French reinforcements brought
the movement to a check. And now the French Artillery opened
fire on our following lines, and we had a taste of what it means to
come down hill in the sweep of shrapnel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our gunners were, however, quickly on the spot. They had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>been waiting behind till room was made for them, but till they
picked up the range our losses were terrible, and I think that that
following line must have lost a larger percentage than any other
troops this day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French fighting line was now sagging to the rear, and
their last reinforcement—a still intact division—was yet some
500 yards away from them, when I noticed a couple of cavalry
officers pass close to where I stood in the copse, take in the whole
scene at a glance, and gallop away.</p>

<p class='c011'>I knew then what was coming; it would be the death stroke
if given in time, before the fresh French Infantry had actually
joined the fighting line. These were now not 300 yards away
from their comrades when the first squadron passed me galloping
straight down the hill in column of troops. The first squadron no
sooner had its last troop clear of our Infantry front, than it
wheeled into line, and went right at the flank of the French, who
attempted to fall back to meet it, but gave way at the last moment
and ran right back on the reinforcements, and pell-mell fugitives
and pursuers crashed right into the angle of these fresh troops.
The second squadron followed, then a third and fourth. The confusion
became indescribable, and now by the same track an
endless succession of squadrons began to emerge, for the first
arrivals had been only the Divisional regiment, and two whole
fresh Cavalry Divisions were now to follow. On the French side,
too, a Cavalry Division appeared coming out through the line of
guns in line of squadron columns, and a cavalry duel was now
imminent.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not much time on our side to prepare for it. The
first regiment of the leading Division joined in the charge on the
Infantry, but that blow sufficed, and the whole mass began to
break up and fall to the rear with increasing velocity. The
remaining squadrons, as they arrived, formed line to the front,
and awaited the arrival of their fellows.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as the 1st Division had completed its formation, it
trotted forward to meet the enemy, who were now only some 800
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>yards distant. Both sides were suffering from Artillery fire, and
there was no room for manœuvre. The gallop and charge were
sounded simultaneously, and the shock took place all along the
front; but the German files were not closed as well as on former
occasions, and the two lines fairly threaded each other, then
wheeled about by troops, and went for one another again. Then
a closed, locked, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span></i> arose, and the fight became stationary.
But our 2d Division was now rapidly arriving, and its leading
brigade delivered a shock which set the mass in motion towards
the French guns. Then another brigade was sent in, and this
fairly started it on the run, and in a few seconds the whole confused
mob of over 6000 horsemen was flying in wild confusion right
down on and over the gunners, who again tried to limber up, but
were again too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>The battle was over, the French line pierced, their last closed
reserves broken, and we had a brigade of Cavalry and masses of
Infantry, who had not yet pulled a trigger, in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>I looked at my watch, it was just 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and I turned and
rode for the nearest wire. Crossing the ground over which we
had come, I was able to notice that our two divisions had both
still a regiment in hand, and of the following Corps only the
Corps Artillery had been engaged, so we were in ample strength
for the pursuit.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE LESSON OF THE FIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>What the effect of this victory will be on the course of the
war it is too soon to prophesy. It may very well prove decisive,
for we have now driven a wedge right in between the French
Armies, behind their eastern and northern defences, and stand
with five Corps on either face of the wedge, with three more in
between ready to move to the support of either. The French
must either move against us by lateral roads and railways, in
which case we can always meet them on a broader front, or
attempt to concentrate far away to the southward, and in any case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>our strength is morally more than doubled by our successes. The
Germans took the field with no overweening opinion of themselves.
They are a modest people, as a whole, given to pessimism
about themselves, and ready to believe the overdone reports as to
the regeneration of their hereditary enemy that reached them
through the public Press. The French, on the other hand, had
again learnt to believe in themselves; their journalists, who were
not going to do the fighting, had lauded them to the skies, while the
nation and rank and file had believed all they were told, even if
the experienced soldiers had not. They have fought with the
greatest gallantry, but for the second time it has been their want
of thoroughness that has ruined them. In each arm and every
branch they were just a little behind their adversaries. They lost
two clear days in mobilisation, and hence were strategically
unready when the blow fell. Their Cavalry was brave, but not a
match for the Germans in mobility, and consequently was beaten.
The defeat of the Cavalry led the Infantry to blunder into a trap
where no human courage could avail them, and this again entailed
a concentration backward, with the obligation of standing on the
defensive to await the arrival of a reinforcing Corps which came
just too late; and the consequences we have seen in to-day’s fight.
I do not believe the Germans have lost very heavily, though
isolated bodies may certainly have done so. But the three arms
played into each other’s hands so perfectly, and the arrival of the
supports was so well timed, that none were ever called on for
exertions beyond their strength. Such tactical handling has never
been seen since Napoleon’s days. But there is this difference to
note, that this time the troops have handled themselves instead of
being handled by the General.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is too early yet for a list of casualties to have been made
out, but at the last moment I learn that our Cavalry yesterday
lost 20 per cent. of their strength.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE WAR IN THE FAR EAST—THE CAPTURE OF VLADIVOSTOCK.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>DETAILS OF THE ENGAGEMENT.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A correspondent at Hong-Kong telegraphs under date July
18th as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Every one is engaged in discussing what we shall do with
Eastern Siberia, now that we have got it. The fall of Vladivostock
was so sudden, and so apparently easy of accomplishment, that it
almost seems as if the Admiral, Sir Frederick Richards, and
General Barker are likely to lose the credit of the success which
they themselves achieved.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is known that the 1st Battalion Leinster Regiment, together
with the 1st Battalion of the 4th Goorkhas, the 21st Bombay
Rifles, another Bombay regiment, and two batteries of Artillery,
were dispatched to Hong-Kong from India at the very beginning
of the troubles, and that they were joined there by 1000 of the
finest men ever seen from Australia, with distinct orders to the
Admiral and the General at Hong-Kong (who was given the
military command) to operate against Vladivostock.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Leander</em> and <em>Mercury</em> were instantly sent to the north to
reconnoitre, while the remainder of the squadron was brought to
Hong-Kong, it being understood that cruisers would be detached
from the East Indian and Australian stations to guard Singapore
and the Straits.</p>

<p class='c011'>Except two ships which claimed protection in the neutral
waters of Japan, it was known that all the Russian squadron had
retired to Vladivostock. Telegrams had further informed the
Admiral that four ships from the Pacific station had been ordered
to Yokohama to wait his orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was frightful work getting the necessary armaments and
stores on board the transports, from the intense heat prevailing;
but there was much less sickness than might have been supposed,
the new troops being roomily housed on board the steamers which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>were to take them north, and kept employed, except during the
greatest heat, in assisting in all the work of preparing and loading
the transports. In rather over five weeks everything was finished,
and the <em>Archer</em> and <em>Swift</em> being left to guard Hong-Kong in the
event of any stray Russian cruiser appearing, the remaining thirteen
ships of the squadron, headed by the Admiral in the <em>Imperieuse</em>,
who had the General with him, and convoying fifteen or sixteen
transport, store, and collier steamers, sailed for Vladivostock.</p>

<p class='c011'>The harbour of Vladivostock is one of the finest in the world.
It lies east and west, and is about two miles long in those directions,
while it is about half a mile wide from north to south. All over
this fine space there is a clear depth of from five to nine fathoms—precisely
that of greatest convenience for an anchorage. The
town is situated at the north-west angle of the harbour, and the
latter is everywhere overlooked by high ground, but especially
from the south. The immediate entrance to the harbour is by a
passage a mile and a half long and three-quarters of a mile wide,
lying about N.N.E. and S.S.W., and opening into the west part of
the inner harbour. This passage is formed by a peninsula not
more than half a mile wide at any part, and more than three miles
long. It is generally high ground, rising in parts to 300 feet.
The entrance to Vladivostock is wholly covered by the large
island of Kazakavitch, which measures five or six miles either
way, and contains in itself the very fine and extended harbour of
Novik Bay. The strait between this island and the mainland,
which must be entered to pass into Vladivostock Harbour, narrows
gradually, but with much indentation and many anchorages, to
the west entrance, formed between the Shkota Peninsula before
described, and the island. At this point it is only about one-third
of a mile wide, and the north shore is the end of a very
narrow, sandy spit, about a third of a mile long.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was known that for years past the Russians had been erecting
batteries and placing mines to guard the approaches to their
harbour, and were there no other way of advancing to attack but
by sea, up the channel and into the harbour, no place is so easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>defended. But as it turned out, and is now recognised, no place
is more difficult to defend when attacked in the proper way. It
is near the end of a peninsula itself, and troops landed from
anchorages at the heads of the two bays which form the peninsula,
can easily isolate and cut the town off from the mainland, and so
take it in the rear.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was at first thought that our expedition would follow this
plan of attack, but the rendezvous made by signal immediately on
leaving Hong-Kong, namely, Novik Bay, set that question at rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>It took the fleet ten days to reach Novik Bay, but, off
Korsakov Island, it was joined by the <em>Melpomene</em>, <em>Daphne</em>,
<em>Champion</em> and <em>Garnet</em>, from the Pacific, and so made up to seventeen
sail in all. A few hours after, the <em>Leander</em> and <em>Mercury</em>
rejoined, reporting that there was a small garrison—perhaps 150
men—occupying the two batteries covering the entrance to Novik
Bay, and probably protecting a mine field, but no other batteries
or garrisons were known to be on the island. The ships had been
twice chased by four ships coming out of Vladivostock, but in
obedience to orders had not attempted to bring them to action,
and had easily out-steamed them each time.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole squadron now lay-to off the entrance to the bay,
while 500 men of the Sutherland Highlanders were landed south
of the entrance with directions to capture the southern battery,
assisted by the fire of the <em>Leander</em> and <em>Mercury</em>, and to turn the
guns on the northern battery, also assisted by the ships.</p>

<p class='c011'>This turned out to be a very small affair. The Russians taken
in rear and engaged in front, fled into the forest long before our
troops closed; and the northern battery, seeing what had happened,
fired one or two shots from the very light guns which the battery
contained, spiked them, and retired. The cables to the mines
were discovered and cut, and within four hours afterwards the
whole armament was safely anchored in Novik Bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next two days were entirely occupied in filling up with
coal from two colliers, and settling the final arrangements for
attack. The Admiral himself, taking the General with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>hoisted his flag in the <em>Alacrity</em>, and ran up the west shore of the
Shkota Peninsula, drawing the fire of a small battery at its south
end, and of one or two heavier ones at the back of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the third day, all was astir at daylight. Most of the boats
of the squadron were alongside the transports, and troops to the
number of nearly 3000 were crowded into them, besides the field-pieces
of the ships, and their crews. The steam launches and
pinnaces soon took lines of these loaded boats in tow, and steamed
out of the bay, whence five or six of the war ships had preceded
them. In a very few minutes these latter were engaging the little
battery on the end of Cape Tokarofski, as the low sandy spit is
called, which made but a very feeble reply, and soon hoisted a
white flag. There were only twenty men in it, and three small
guns, so that resistance would have been hopeless. It was ascertained
to be the mine station for a line of mines across the Strait.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plan of attack was now cleverly developed. The landing
was effected all along the west shore of the Shkota Peninsula,
and in spite of the rough scrub with which it is covered, the
seamen dragged the field-pieces along the shore to the north. No
resistance was offered; it was impossible to offer any under the
guns of the ships, and by noon the whole body were halted for
dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a valley about half-way along the peninsula lying
about N.E. and S.W., opening on to the harbour at the northern
end, and on to the sea at the southern end. It was supposed that
resistance would be encountered here, though it was not intended
to march through it, but to adhere to the shore and the cover of
the ships until the town could be turned.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, after dinner the advanced guard had no sooner
opened this valley than it was met by a heavy rifle and gun fire
from a strong detachment posted and entrenched across the head
of it. But the General was not to be caught napping. He had
sent four field-pieces up the hill on his right, which from its brow
poured a wholly unexpected and murderous fire down upon the
Russians. This they did not stand for ten minutes, and our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>march went on. Then the field-pieces on this height found themselves
overlooking the harbour, and at once turned their attention
to shelling the ships in it, though the distance was too great to
admit of effective fire.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE TAKING OF VLADIVOSTOCK: GOORKAS PROTECTING THE GUNS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>At this time the ships, ten or twelve of them, spread themselves
in a long line ahead of the advancing column, and searched
every foot of ground, which could be easily done as it was
generally low.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were several batteries discovered facing seaward, which
the ships engaged. The Russians stuck to their guns most manfully,
and some of our ships suffered very heavily, but none of
the batteries had any efficient rear defences, and as the gunners
caught sight of the head of our column advancing by the shore,
they invariably abandoned their works and retired to the northward,
along the road that leads round that part of the harbour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fearing an attempt might be made to dislodge the field-pieces
on the height, a wing of the Goorkhas was sent up to reinforce
them, and it was quite a sight to see these little fellows swarming
up like so many ants.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now the signallers with the field-pieces got to the highest
point of ground, and very soon telegraphed to the Admiral that
the ships might shell the Russian troops by firing on the signal
station, which the troops surrounded. Some of the ships could
see the station, and in obedience to signal from the Admiral began
to shell it. The signallers directed the fire from the ships, so
that, without seeing the object, it was immensely destructive, and
ultimately forced the Russians to retreat.</p>

<p class='c011'>This being again communicated to the ships and to the
landing party now mustering in strength at the back of the
town, a general advance was made, before which the Russians
fell back, and ultimately sent in a flag of truce with terms of
surrender.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our loss was very small; only one officer of the Bombay
Regiment, and 42 men killed; 5 officers and 134 men wounded.
Nor was the Russian loss much greater, being estimated at 67
killed and 203 wounded. It was the skill of the attack in turning
the Russian defences, and the immense use that was made of
the fire from the ships, which produced a result astonishing to
those who had not inquired into its causes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The course of events in the Black Sea, since our fleet for the
time evacuated it, has been as follows:—It appears that as soon
as the Russian Fleet was driven off the sea into harbour, immediate
steps were taken by the Russian authorities to withdraw the
troops which had been gathered for the purpose of reinforcing the
troops already landed in Bulgaria. Unable to pass by sea they
were useless for that purpose; and it was hoped, if they were sent
off at once to reinforce the armies opposing Austria, that a successful
action against that Power might enable the victorious
army, co-operating with the army already in Bulgaria, to make
the passage through Roumania by land and, at least, ensure the
safety of the expeditionary force in Bulgaria. Perhaps it might
be possible in that case to secure the object, dear to the heart of
the Czar, of so strengthening that expeditionary force as to enable
it to crush the Bulgarian Army. The deepest anxiety prevailed
in Russia as to the fate of those troops, somewhat rashly committed
to the sea expedition, no sufficient allowance having been
made for the prompt action of the English Fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was some time before the Russian Fleet, which had retired
to Sebastopol, discovered that the English Fleet had actually
evacuated the Black Sea. Sir George Tryon had left some
cruisers as long as possible to disguise the movement. When
these also disappeared, a fear was entertained that this was a
mere ruse to draw the Russian Fleet away from Sebastopol in
order to crush it in the open sea. We regret to say that it was
through the telegraphic dispatches to the English newspapers
that, by various indirect channels, the news first reached the
Russian Government that Trebizonde had been evacuated and,
subsequently, that the English Fleet had passed into the Mediterranean.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>It was, however, not till Sir George Tryon had actually
reached Malta that they were fully aware that the Black Sea had
been evacuated. Then it was, after a day of hesitation as to the
best course to be pursued, decided to establish touch with the
Russian Army in Bulgaria, all communication with which had
been cut for some time. As, however, that army—not without
difficulty—had maintained its telegraphic communication
with the sea, this was effected soon after the cruisers had reached
the coast, in the neighbourhood of Varna.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was then ascertained that the Bulgarian force in Varna
itself was still holding out; and that the Russian Army, reduced to
about 35,000 men by the force left to guard the lines to the sea,
by the covering force at Varna and Shumla, and by sickness, had
been able to effect very little. It had at first advanced inland as far
as Tirnova, where it remained in an entrenched camp, waiting for
information. It was believed that the Austrian force in Servia had
been too much reduced to be able to advance, and that the
Bulgarian troops were fully occupied in Macedonia. Had the
force landed been carried up to the figure that was intended, an
immediate advance on Sofia would have been attempted. As the
case stood, however, General Karanoff did not feel himself strong
enough for this, and as now his only hope was to have the way
through Roumania opened, he had turned northwards, having sent
messengers through to communicate by land with Russia. He
had, however, found it impossible to effect the passage of the
Danube up to the moment when he received the joyful telegram
announcing that, in consequence of the departure of the English
Fleet, it was possible either to withdraw him by sea in safety, or
to reinforce him. As there seemed every prospect that a great
success might yet be achieved, if the force originally intended
could now be landed in Bulgaria, the cruiser carried back proposals
to that effect. Meanwhile, however, much time had been
lost. The greater part of the Russian troops had been sent inland
by train from the sea-board. Though they were at once reembarked
on all available lines, very little had been done more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>than preparing for embarkation at Odessa, Sebastopol, and other
ports, when the news of the Battle of Sardinia created a sudden
alarm that the Black Sea would not long be a safe place for
Russian ships. For the next ten days tremendous efforts were
made to hurry the embarkation of the troops, but by the end of
that time news reached the Russians that large numbers of English
cruisers had already appeared in the Black Sea.</p>

    <div>LORD WOLSELEY IN CONSTANTINOPLE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>News of the dispatch of the reinforcements to the Mediterranean
Fleet, announced by our naval correspondent a fortnight
ago, had reached the Russian Government, unfortunately again
through the enterprise of some English correspondents, whose
information was telegraphed <em>viâ</em> New York, and thence by a route
not as yet clearly traced to some Russian agents, who managed to
get it to their Government very rapidly. It was therefore taken
for granted that the cruisers would be promptly followed by such
ships as Admiral Tryon could spare. When then the first of
Admiral Markham’s line-of-battle ships appeared, the Russian
Fleet, afraid of being caught whilst involved in assisting in the
transport of the troops and stores to Varna, once more retired,
part to Odessa, and part to Sebastopol. Our own cruisers immediately
re-occupied the littoral of Bulgaria near Varna. They
were successful in capturing one of the transports that was
attempting to escape. We have been favoured with these particulars,
which have been gathered from the prisoners captured on
this transport. As far as can be ascertained the reinforcements
landed on this occasion have, in consequence of the delays recorded,
not exceeded 15,000 or 20,000 men. Nearly all of them
are reported to have marched to join General Karanoff who is
supposed to be between the Danube and Tirnova, at which point
he is expected to effect his junction with the reinforcements.</p>

<p>BRITISH TRANSPORTS PASSING THE DARDANELLES—FORT CHANAK SALUTING THE ENGLISH SHIPS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The greatest alarm exists at Sofia. The Bulgarian troops are still
much involved in the Macedonian campaign, and, though as many
as possible have been recalled for the defence of the capital, it
was feared that, with the sea open, the Russians would be able to
pour in irresistible numbers. And, though that danger is now
over, if General Karanoff has once more under his hands an effective
force of 60,000 men, or nearly so, it is believed that he may
yet make a bold dash for the capital. The moment the news of
the Battle of Sardinia reached Spain, Sir Evelyn Wood’s troops,—which
had been held in readiness to sail at two hours’ notice from
Cadiz and Gibraltar,—passed eastwards. The news reached Alexandria
and Cyprus on the same day. Embarkation was very
rapid at Alexandria. The garrison there had been largely reinforced
in order to facilitate embarkation, in consequence of the
difficulties of keeping a large fleet of transports for a long time in
the open roadstead at Famagousta. The whole of the Army of
Occupation will be temporarily employed on the Eastern expedition.
Sir Francis Grenfell has announced his confidence that he
will be able, for the time the war lasts, to ensure the safety of
Egypt, provided that, should any serious movement be threatened
by the Mahdi, he is supported by a certain number of native
troops from India. This has been provided for. Within twenty-four
hours ten thousand troops in all were ready to sail from
Alexandria. On the other hand, progress at Cyprus has been
much slower. The wind not having been favourable for some
days, a large part of the transports were obliged to put to sea;
and when the embarkation began, the difficulties of embarking
were very serious.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every one in the island is groaning over the fact that nothing
has been done to develop the splendid old harbour of Famagousta
during our occupation. However, the first of the transports were
ready to sail in a day or two. As it was necessary to await
the arrival of Admiral Markham’s Fleet, or, at least, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>cruisers, before passing out of the Sea of Marmora, the ships
sailed as they were ready, and the rendezvous was formed after
passing the Dardanelles. The first troopers to arrive in the Sea
of Marmora were those from Alexandria. These were followed
immediately by about 5000 men from Malta, who had been
detained there when the alarm due to the French Declaration of
War caused the check to the expedition. The garrison has, like
that of Gibraltar, been reduced to a very low ebb, and will be
made up by the Militia regiments, who have most patriotically
volunteered for service in the Mediterranean garrisons. A portion
of the troopers from Cyprus followed; but as soon as they had
entered the Sea of Marmora, Admiral Markham’s battle-ships
passed through. The cruisers sent on to protect the movement
had already entered the Black Sea, and been followed by those
from Admiral Markham’s Fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Evelyn Wood’s force from Gibraltar and Cadiz, rather less
than eight days from thence, arrived before nearly the whole of
the force from Cyprus had come in. On the tenth day after the
battle of Sardinia—that is, on June 4, the fleet of transports,
headed by Sir Evelyn Wood’s troopers, began the entry into the
Black Sea. At the moment we write, we hear that the whole of
the transports carrying all the troops, except the half Corps
originally detained in England, have been lost to sight from land,
sailing east. As soon (as was recorded in our issue of May 28th)
as the seven battle-ships and cruisers from the Baltic were known
to be on their way to England, the remaining half Corps was
embarked from the home ports, and the entire fleet, with the
troopers, reached Gibraltar about forty-eight hours after Sir Evelyn
Wood had sailed. The troopers have accordingly now entered the
Sea of Marmora, and will, no doubt, follow the rest of the fleet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Lord Wolseley has been in Constantinople for some time. He
was there in telegraphic communication with all the different
bodies of troops and with England. He was more conveniently
able to obtain fresh information from all quarters, and to be in
communication with our Ambassador and the Porte. He watched
from Dolma Baghtche the magnificent sight of the passage of our
fleet and troopers towards the Black Sea. Admiral Markham
embarked in the Ambassador’s yacht, after a long conference with
Lord Wolseley, and followed up his own fleet; but we learn that
just before the first troopers of the detachment from England
began to pass the Dardanelles, the yacht returned, and Lord
Wolseley embarked in it, leaving sealed orders for the detachment
from England. We hear that Lord Wolseley talks much
of the advantages of a campaign in Asia Minor, and that actually
Trebizonde has again been occupied by an advanced detachment.
Moukhtar Pacha, having been largely reinforced, is still holding
his own very well on that side. Further than that we know as
yet nothing of the nature of the future campaign. Another week
will, however, no doubt throw much light on the subject.</p>

    <div>PROPOSAL TO SEIZE NEW CALEDONIA.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Melbourne</span>, <em>June 2</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Age</em> and the <em>Argus</em> of this day’s date publish the results
of several interviews. I wire you a synopsis of the ten newspaper
columns which feed the curiosity of Australian readers. Lord
Hopetoun and Lord Jersey are essentially and quite naturally
non-committal. They unite in declaring that, so far, the Colonial
attitude and action have the full approval of the Home Government,
but they both decline to lend countenance to the combined
action of the Governments of Victoria and New South Wales.
Mr. Justice Windeyer, of Sydney, and Mr. Justice Way, of
Adelaide, are at one in the opinion that, France and England
being at open warfare, the Australian Fleet may at once be
legitimately employed in operations against the enemy without
leave obtained from the Home Government.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Sir Thomas M‘Ilwraith exults in the prospect of the fulfilment
of his life-long dream. He, more than any other Colonial statesman,
has been interested in the preservation of purely British influence
in the Southern Hemisphere, and he sees in the present
European conflict a certain promise that the blundering ineptitude
of Lord Derby and his successors will be finally rendered harmless.
The fact that England is fighting shoulder to shoulder with Germany
will, Sir Thomas thinks, facilitate a friendly exchange by means
of which the north-eastern portion of New Guinea may be brought
under the dominion of the British Crown. He insists, with some
vehemence, on the undoubted fact, that if his own policy had not
been obstructed by the Home authorities, the northern waters of
these seas would have been given over to the undivided empire of
Great Britain, and he urges strongly the advisability of seizing
the present moment to undo the blunders of the past. He
approves warmly of the combined action of New South Wales
and Victoria, and declares that their proposal to seize New
Caledonia is not merely statesmanlike and patriotic, but could
hardly have been avoided in the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>In New South Wales Sir Henry Parkes and the Hon. Mr. Dibbs
sink, for once, all party differences, and the venerable Leader of the
Opposition supports the action of the Government as warmly as
if it had been taken at his own initiative. Here, in Melbourne, the
Government and Opposition are, in quite as pronounced a fashion,
at one with each other. In short, outside the Governors, whose
official position condemns them to neutrality, there is not a dissentient
voice to be heard. New Caledonia has long been a thorn
in the Australian side. It is only 700 miles from the coast of
Queensland, and the northern colony and its parent neighbour
have long since tired of being overrun by escaped French convicts
of the vilest type. You, in England, have little conception of the
resentment which is inspired in the breasts of the most loyal
Australians by the supineness and folly which allowed the Home
Government to sit idly by whilst a French penal settlement was
established so near our shores. Australia complains, and complains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>with justice, that she has been treated from the first as a
reservoir into which might be poured the most abominable draff
of English society. It was bad enough, and more than bad
enough, to be compelled to receive the refuse of the Home
Country. But when the escapes from New Caledonia began to
be so numerous as to prove a decided nuisance, the indignation of
the public was naturally aroused. Whatever you may think of us
in England, we Australians are, at least, a patient and enduring
people. We have made mild demonstrations in the way of
departmental remonstrance, and have done nothing more. Had
we been stronger than we are we should long since have made the
presence of the French Government in New Caledonia a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus
belli</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Mother Country is so indifferent to our aspirations and
our needs, that she has never given herself the trouble to recognise
the gravity of this special cause of complaint. At least
300 cases of escape from New Caledonia to Australian shores are
known and recorded. In the case of the ‘exiles’ we naturally
rejoice. We have given home and a glad welcome to that distinguished
artist, M. Henri, who was banished from his native
France for his political opinions, and who has now achieved for
himself a perfectly unique position in Australian art. There is,
assuredly, not one man in the Australian Continent who would
willingly have put an obstacle in the way of escape of M. Henri
Rochefort. It is not men of this type to whose presence in our
neighbourhood we object. But it is undeniable that the French
criminals who now people New Caledonia, are men of the most
abominable of all conceivable types. The grievance—the true
grievance—is not merely that the French Government should
have been allowed to defile our neighbourhood by the deportation
of these people, but that they should positively have determined
to perpetuate the race. How many people in England are aware
of the shameful and stupid fact that the French Government,
having massed its most awful male outcasts in New Caledonia,
deliberately sent out to them female convicts of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>abandoned type in order that the men might marry and reproduce
their own likeness? The mere incidental question of bigamy
by government authority need scarcely be considered. Amongst
the women sent out were parricides, simple murdresses, and
creatures soiled by all the crimes of which nature is capable.
One of the brides had murdered both her father and her mother,
and another, on the outward voyage, threw her own baby out of a
port-hole. The sires of the future French settlement were, of
course, worthy of their partners, and one may fairly ask what
could possibly be expected of a race so founded. I have myself
spoken with Englishmen upon this question, and have been met
with a laugh, a shrug of the shoulders, and an allusion to an
ancient proverb about a pot and kettle. It is undeniable that
Hobart Town and Botany Bay welcomed in their time a great
deal of human evil, but it never came unalloyed, and an examination
of facts will teach any inquirer that a good fifty per cent. of
the so-called crimes for which men and women were expatriated,
were no more than the ebullitions of an impatient patriotism, or
the escapades of unguided youth. Leaving that aside, nobody
pretends that the Australian population of three and a half
millions is seriously tainted. We are troubled by certain forms of
rowdyism and brutality, and we have a dangerous class rooted
amongst us. That a great law-abiding population should be handicapped
in that way by the past action of the Mother Country was
hard enough to bear in all conscience, but that England should
have sat supine whilst a foreign power doubled, trebled, and
quadrupled, the curse upon our borders is intolerable.</p>

<p class='c011'>We Anglo-Saxons are everywhere a long-suffering and rather
stupid people. Australia herself has been somewhat to blame for
her own partial acquiescence in this injustice, and there are vast
numbers of her inhabitants who know little and care less about
the question. The Australian citizen who had suffered from the
inroads of a gang of foreign desperadoes has a sympathetic interest
in the matter, but he is only one in ten thousand, and the fact is
that we have been far too tame.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The distance between New Caledonia and Australia is, as I
have said already, about 700 miles. That between the Sandwich
Islands and the United States is about 2000 miles. But those
islands are directly under American control, and the United States
have always held that the presence of a foreign power there would
have to be regarded as a menace. Just as she warned away
France from Mexico, she would now warn away any foreign
intruder in the South Seas. It is easy to conceive that England
herself might have been equally wise. The French treatment of
the Canaques, whom they dispossessed when they took forcible
possession of the island, has been wrong-headed in the extreme.
They have had the absurdest panics about impossible native
risings, and have sent out numberless expeditions to destroy the
food supplies of the wretched natives. Things are quieter now,
and the Canaques are effectively cowed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was decided last night by telegraphic communication between
the Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, that the two
leading Colonies should jointly invite Queensland, Western
Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania to lend their authority
for the immediate dispatch of the Australian squadron to Noumea.
An intimation of the fact has been sent to the Home Government,
but no permission has been asked. It is not in the least likely
that England will interfere with us at such a moment, and on
such a question, but even if she did, the question is one so vitally
affecting the destinies of Australia that we should be compelled to
take the matter into our own hands.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LORD CHARLES SCOTT OBJECTS.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-r c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>June 6.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is a rumour abroad to the effect that Admiral Lord
Charles Scott has put his veto on the dispatch of the fleet until
such time as instructions can be received from England, but
though this report has been angrily seized upon by the populace,
no credence whatever appears to be attached to it in quarters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>where the most trustworthy information might naturally be looked
for. It has served, however, to enliven the city to a very
remarkable extent, and the mere hint of opposition to the popular
will has created a widespread excitement, and has made it evident
that the men of the colonies are bent on having their own way.
Collins Street and Bourke Street are patrolled by vast bands, who
groan loudly at the name of the Admiral and cheer the local
leaders of public opinion. It is quite a fortuitous occurrence that
the various bodies of Melbourne cadets had arranged to march
with their bands through the principal streets this evening, but
the event has given colour and stir to the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">al fresco</span></i> entertainment
provided by the populace for their own delectation. Special
editions of the evening papers confirm the rumoured action of the
Admiral, and the excitement is growing to fever heat. Lord
Charles Scott’s position is that the squadron of which he holds
command is intended for defensive purposes only, and cannot be
legitimately employed in offensive operations without the direct
sanction of the war authorities at home. He is likely to be
technically in the right, but the fact that England and France are
already actively engaged is generally held here, amongst the most
moderate men, to abrogate this rule, and to make it the immediate
and obvious duty of Australia to take her place in action. In the
meantime, so the Sydney telegrams inform us, the squadron now
lying in the harbour there is making every preparation for active
service, and it is entirely probable that, after all, no real delay
may ensue.</p>

<p class='c011'>After all, there will be no waiting. A telegraphic dispatch
has been received from the Admiralty, and the instructions are
that the squadron shall take instant action. A special train to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Sydney has been chartered by the Premier. He will be accompanied
by three or four members of the Ministry, and I have
succeeded in attaching myself to the party. The train starts in
an hour.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The Ministerial train has broken the record, and at four o’clock
the Ministerial party is steaming across the beautiful harbour
towards the flagship. Driving hurriedly through the streets of the
city, we have had time to see no more than that the main
thoroughfares are gay with bunting, though the streets themselves
are empty. The whole population has turned out to witness the
departure of the squadron, and from the deck of the launch a
crowd of many scores of thousands is visible about Lady Macquarrie’s
Chair. The great harbour is thronged with every kind
of craft. All the merchant ships are gaily decorated everywhere.
The weather is heavenly, and the harbour, with its sparkling
waters and majestic lines of headland, can rarely have been seen
to more advantage. The spirit of the people is evidently and
entirely in the enterprise on which they have embarked. The
four ships of the Australian squadron lie in sight of the vast
crowd, and are already volleying clouds of smoke. As I lift my
eyes from the note-book in which I am rapidly scrawling these
lines, I can see that the great hulk of the flagship has begun to
move. Flash goes a gun from her black side, and a hundred
rolling echoes bellow from the surrounding heights. The crowd
sends back a heart-stirring cheer, and a gun from the fort responds
to the Admiral’s salute. Vessel after vessel salutes, and the fort
answers each in turn. Like leviathans afloat move our bulwarks
on the brine, a score of times huger than when Campbell sung the
prowess of the British arms at sea. Before we can reach the flagship
they are all well under weigh, and forging grandly towards
the open waters. Aboard some of the yachts and launches are
brass bands, not all of the finest quality. They play ‘God save
the Queen’ in all manner of keys and in different times. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>result is not what one might fancy, for everybody seems to find it
wildly exhilarating. The cheers from the immense concourse
near Government House grow fainter and fainter as we recede,
and at last die away altogether. There is a fresh breeze in the
open, and a roughish sea, and so in a while even the most
enthusiastic of the pursuers are willing to turn back again. The
spectacle is over. The squadron has steamed away, and Australia
stands ready to strike her first blow in the cause of the British
race in the seas of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>A whole week has passed and we have not moved. Our
cavalry and most of my Corps are enjoying the hospitality of the
French barracks at the camp of Chalons, horribly dirty, still,
better than a bivouac in the pouring rain we have been enduring.
Our officers’ patrols go daily south of Chalons-sur-Marne and
eastward to Bar-le-Duc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rheims is observed—practically invested—for our scouts tear
up the railways leading to it from Paris as fast as the enemy
can lay them down again, and further to the westward patrols are
in touch with the French Army of the North, and we learn that
troops are daily being moved by rail to the southward, which
corroborates other information that they are again going to try on
us Bourbaki’s stroke of 1870, and, under the circumstances, it is
about the best thing they can do.</p>

<p class='c011'>In our rear the Reserve Divisions are working day and night
to complete our road and railway communications with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Namur-Luxembourg Railway, and as everything has been foreseen
to the smallest detail years in advance—even the girders for
bridges made and kept in stock—and the country, moreover,
presents no serious difficulties (certainly none to frighten our
engineers of Afghanistan experience, and the Germans are but
little behind us), I have no doubt that our halt here will be but
of short duration; indeed, some of the roads are evidently through
already, for our Reserve ammunition waggons came up yesterday.
The line through Mezières-Givet is also expected to be open in a
day or two, and then our siege train will be able to take the works
of Rheims under fire in earnest. This delay, I need hardly say,
is very much against the feelings of our Hotspurs, and I have
listened to many an oration from young subalterns to prove how
differently old Moltke would have led them. With due deference,
I think it can be shown from his own works that he would have
done nothing of the kind. His own saying was that the art of
war was only the practical application of principles to the attainment
of the end in view—viz., the subjugation of the enemy to
your will—at what knowledge of the circumstances shows you to
be at the moment the cheapest possible cost to the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1870, with a vast numerical superiority, no fortifications to
speak of on the enemy’s side, and no allies on his own, the principle
of extermination by a series of battles was the best policy to
adopt. How, against almost equal numbers, backed by fortresses
not to be despised—the first victory having been won and the
fighting value of our troops thereby doubled—our best game is
not to break our heads against the enemy’s strong places, but in a
central position to await his offensive returns and move out to
meet him—not stand to be attacked—as soon as his plans are
sufficiently indicated by our cavalry outposts.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a wise stroke on the part of the enemy to lead off with
a first blow from Russia; but we countered it by the immediate
assumption of the offensive, which enabled us to score first blood
against France. For the present we can await the decision in
Russia in comparative security.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>The troops are not idle meanwhile. After a day’s rest and
the reorganisation of the regiments in consequence of losses—which,
by the way, amount to only 10 per cent. in the Corps
engaged—they were at work again drilling with the same intensity
of purpose as if the spring inspections and not a battle lay before
them. That was a lesson they learnt from the last war—viz.,
that the command of men in the squadron or company is personal
property, and cannot be handed over like charge of the quartermaster’s
store. A leader must know his men, and they must
know him by actual contact on the parade ground if the full
fighting worth is to be got out of the men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another victory; now I may tell you all that has happened
in the order in which it occurred. As I had anticipated, the
French have again tried Bourbaki’s move, with much the same
results. As far as we can learn, three Corps were transferred
from the line of the northern fortresses, by Paris—Lyons, and the
whole of their Army of the East moved northward to meet us, their
right on the line of their eastern defences.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our 2d Army moved up both banks of the Aisne to meet them,
it was theoretically wrong, no doubt, but we could not help it.
The 3d passed troops over the Meuse, to form on their left, and
we—<em>i.e.</em> the 1st—detached three Corps to reinforce the right,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>leaving two ‘field’ Corps and a number of Reserve Divisions (I
understand six) to hold the Army of the North in check, and
retire slowly before it if seriously attacked.</p>

<p class='c011'>My Corps rendezvoused on the 26th at 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> around Suippes.
The country had been thoroughly reconnoitred, and, guided by
officers of the Topographical Staff, all combatant branches moved
straight across country, in the good old Napoleonic method, trains
and Corps Artillery only by the roads. The rain had ceased, and
the going was fairly good; anyway, we all agreed that it was
infinitely preferable work to stewing in dusty lanes in closed
columns, with never a breath of fresh air, even though in the
bottoms the soil was somewhat heavy. The men were in the best
of spirits at the start—reviving the good old march to Sedan joke,
‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mit Armen links schwenkt! Gerade aus</span>’—but the sun came out,
and by 5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, when we had covered nearly twenty miles as the crow
flies, faces began to look drawn and weary. Then we caught the
sound of the guns in front, and the men stepped out again briskly.</p>

<p class='c011'>About 6.30 we got the order to halt and bivouac; fortunately
we were close to some ponds and a stream. Our cavalry had this
time come little into conflict with the enemy, but after driving in
a few patrols had come on the French infantry, practically deployed
for action, heading a little west of north, and had not attempted
to make any impression. Indeed, there was no reason why they
should, for they could see everything perfectly from some neighbouring
ridges, and so had fulfilled their duties. We, at least,
knew where the enemy was, and he did not know where we were.
So far we had the advantage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fight began with a race for the ridges. We had no particular
advantage, and a scrimmaging fight began at once all along
the line. Our artillery was in great part neutralised; so was that
of the other side. It simply became a struggle of endurance—the
Germans, relying on the superior discipline of their men, could
afford to feed the fighting line more slowly (<em>i.e.</em> with greater distance
between the following lines), and thanks to the perfection
of their Staff, trained to work as nearly as possible under wartime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>conditions, the mechanism of the feed worked with less
friction and more certainty; fresh troops were always forthcoming
when they were required. On the other side the machinery
wanted lubricating, owing to their radically defective conception
of the nature of the infantry fight, which induced them to move
to the attack in a succession of extended lines following one
another too quickly; their strength melted away almost before
they reached the actual fighting line, and then the Staff failed to
send support quickly enough. It was soon evident that they
were bleeding to exhaustion more rapidly than we were.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus hour by hour our attack pressed home like waves of an
incoming tide, and from a distance the effect was most curious to
watch. Two long undulating lines—a light blue haze hanging
over them—each seemed to be backed by some elastic force; as
the equilibrium at one point was disturbed, one line recoiled and
the other pressed forward till flanking fire brought it again to a
stop<a id='t217'></a> for the moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>By noon the edge of the high ground overlooking the valley,
through which runs the Rhine-Marne Canal, was reached, and
now the flood was running strong in our favour. Then we could
see, too, how these disturbances in the equilibrium of the two
lines were occasioned. The smaller units of the French thought
too much of their flanks, too little of their centre. Thus, where
two battalions or companies touched, the men balled up and
crowded together, offering a better target; then the fire from the
centre relaxed, and the moment the pressure of the enemy’s fire
gave way, the Germans dashed forward to fill up the vacuum.
Soon, too, the French endeavoured to bring up their reserves in
column, for their men would no longer advance in extended order;
and now the small calibre rifle and its great penetration justified
its existence; I had not thought much of it before. But the
employment of columns induced a new feature—viz., a tendency
in the larger units (<em>e.g.</em> divisions) to close on their centre—and
presently before our eyes we saw a great gap opening out behind
the enemy’s fighting line. The time for the final blow was close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>at hand. Our gunners, coming up under cover of the hills, were
crushing the artillery of the enemy out in the plain, and had some
attention to spare for his reserves. I saw a cavalry aide-de-camp
leave the Staff of the Army Commander, who was close at hand,
and I made tracks as fast as I could for some broken ground,
where I hoped to be safe from the coming storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty minutes afterwards, heading straight for the gap I
described above, came at least eight squadrons in line at a gallop.
Their ground scouts yelled at their own infantry in front to lie
down, and they mostly did so. The cavalry checked for a moment
at them, as if at a fence, and then swept down on the infantry in
front, not two hundred yards distant, rode over and beyond them,
wheeled outwards, and bore down on the reserves. As they passed
our infantry, the latter threw themselves into groups to let the
second line of cavalry—which still remained in squadron columns—through,
and then four more lines of cavalry followed, and the
whole plain became a sea of dust and confusion. Our infantry
rallied into company columns, and dashed forward with the
bayonet in pursuit, and we had the last tableau of Waterloo over
again. The canal and the stream in the hollow put a stop to our
advance, and fresh infantry with the pioneer companies moved
forward to make good the crossing, which might have been a
troublesome business enough, had not the troops to our left—<em>i.e.</em>
west—already carried the passages at Revigny.</p>

<p class='c011'>Darkness was now rapidly coming on, and the fight here died
away. I rode back to the rear, and found food and a welcome
with the Headquarters of our third Corps, which had only just
reached the ground and had not been engaged.</p>

<p class='c011'>About five next morning the troops again stood to their arms,
but in the night news of an advance of the French Army of the
north had come in, and we began to retrace our steps over the
same ground already traversed. As we were starting, intelligence
of the British victory in the Mediterranean arrived, and with it
rumours of Communistic disturbances in Paris. I was also told
that two Corps had been detached from the 2d Army from near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>St. Menehould, and two more from the Russian frontier had
arrived about Pont-a-Mousson, and with the four Bavarian reserve
divisions were preparing to strike the French Army of the west
in their right flank. At night we reached the line of the great
road Chalons-sur-Marne—St. Menehould, and about 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> fell
right on the flank of a French corps moving from Epernay on the
Camp of Chalons. Part of the Corps from St. Menehould marching
by Suippes was on our right, and together we drove the French
back in some disorder into the complex of hilly ground about
Moronvilliers, cutting them off from Rheims.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Corps left to watch this latter place had fallen back fighting
the previous day, and lay along the road from Suippes by
Somme-puis-Attigny—<em>i.e.</em> about north and south.</p>

<p class='c011'>At daybreak we advanced again, and soon a struggle began
which, in the hilly, wooded ground we now were in, utterly defies
description. As before, it was mainly decided by superior endurance
of loss and a better-trained Staff. Of tactical combination
there was none on a large scale, but divisional artillery and cavalry
suffered heavily in endeavouring to support their comrades of the
infantry.</p>

<p class='c011'>We reached the culminating point of the plateau after five
hours’ successive fighting, but the exhaustion of our men was
extreme; hundreds dropped unable to go a step further, and we
afterwards picked up at least an equal number of French in the
same condition. Indeed, during the last hours of the afternoon, it
had become a struggle of the survival of the fittest. The French
fought with a determination they never before displayed—probably
because the ground, by giving scope to our cavalry on previous
occasions, never gave them the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c011'>But this time every copse and bush gave them the chance to
rally, and many are the instances recounted of how superior officers
on the French side emulated the example of Ney in the retreat
from Russia, and rifle in hand stood to the last.</p>

<p class='c011'>The battle was actually decided by a blow delivered some six
miles to the north, where the ground did give our three arms a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>chance of co-operation, and about 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> the resistance in front
of us gave way altogether. The fighting broke off, and the men
lay on their arms where they stood, too weary to move another
step.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the night, however, a cavalry division belonging to the
2d Army—which had moved round our rear while the action was
going on—beat up the bivouacs of the French, falling first on the
artillery and some cavalry and stampeding their horses, who took
flight right down the extent of the line. And this last blow turned
the French retreat into rout. It was York’s manœuvre at Laon,
in 1814, over again, only more thoroughly carried out.</p>

movement the day before, took up the pursuit before daybreak in
the direction of Rethel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The general situation is as follows:—On the eastern wing the
Germans eventually made some 30,000 prisoners, and drove the
wreck of the Army of the East into Epinal and Belfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving three Corps and the Bavarian reserve divisions to
watch them—the remainder of the second and third Armies are
moving by the valley of the Marne on Paris, their advance guards
to-day reaching Epernay. The available troops of the western
wing drove the enemy before them northwards into Laon and
against the Belgian frontier, making 40,000 prisoners; but at least
60,000 are known to have escaped by rail into Paris.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rheims has been closely invested—my Corps, which lost 25
per cent. in the last action, is in reserve round and about the
village from which I write. The light siege-train arrived here to-day,
and the remainder is expected shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The siege-train arrived here complete on the night of the 10th,
on the 11th it was put in battery; and at daybreak next morning
opened fire against the three forts, Brimont, Fresnes, and Berru.
It was just the same here as before Verdun; within a few hours
our converging fire from covered positions knocked the forts to
pieces, and the French guns were buried in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</span></i> of their own
parapets. Some of their guns, firing by indirect laying, remained
unsilenced; on the other hand, their fire hit nothing to speak of.
The advantage of smokeless powder, combined with indirect laying,
turned entirely in favour of the attack.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>At daybreak on the 12th we moved forward to the attack of
the intermediate positions—not against the forts themselves, for
these were mere mudheaps, so saturated with the carbonic oxide
due to the explosion of our gun-cotton shells that they were
equally untenable by friend or foe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fight presented no special features of interest. It was
noticeable, however, how much the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> of the other side had
been shaken, and how devastating is the power of 40 and 60 lb.
shrapnel fire. The hills on which Berru and Brimont stand were
both in our hands by about noon. Fresnes was surrounded, and
surrendered shortly after. We could pursue down the slopes with
fire only, for Rheims itself was still protected by hasty entrenchments
which, as the sun was beginning to decline, it was hardly
possible to see.</p>

the captured heights, and our outposts reported sounds of firing
and tumult in the town, and, indeed, scarcely had our guns opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>fire next morning when the white flag flew out from the

for a number of territorialists and armed workmen had
broken out in the night, shot the Commandant, and began to
plunder the inhabitants, and as all discipline was at an end the
second in command yielded to the pressure of the inhabitants and
consented to surrender. We cleared the streets without much
difficulty, the rioters bolting like hares as we entered them; and
the good people of Rheims, remembering the good behaviour of
the troops in ’70, welcomed us as friends rather than enemies.</p>

every halting place, fresh news of Anarchistic trouble in Paris
reaches us, and I fancy the end cannot now be far off, everything
depends on the time our engineers and railway troops take to

</div>

<p class='c011'>At daybreak this morning, after a preliminary bombardment of
twenty-four hours, the position between the forts of Vaujours and
Chelles was stormed. The effect of the bombardment was just
what it had been before Rheims, and we left the forts untouched.
The garrisons had taken shelter in the bomb-proofs, and at first
refused to come out; but seeing themselves completely surrounded,
and as the deadly fumes of our bursting shells began to
penetrate into their retreat, they at last came out and laid down
their arms, seeing the impossibility of further resistance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>The line between the two forts was closed with every resource
of field fortification; but they proved of no avail, and only gave
a fresh illustration of the old saying, related of a British soldier
in the Crimean days, who, when taunted by a superior officer with
being afraid of the Russian trenches, replied, ‘It ain’t the ——
mud heaps, it’s the —— that stands behind!’</p>

<p class='c011'>The line depended on the forts for flank defence, and when
these were silenced, the struggle degenerated into a purely frontal
one, in which the immense superiority of our fire in accuracy told.
It was, perhaps, in its commencement, the nearest approach to an
ideal skirmishing fight we have yet had. Covered by the fire of
every available heavy gun—maintained to the last moment
possible—our skirmishers crept in to within the edge of the
obstacles and entanglements, potting every Frenchman as he
showed his head, so that the working parties who followed immediately
behind could cut the wires, etc., at their leisure. In
places dense lines of abattis could not be thus easily dealt with,
but the value of these fell when once the flanks were turned;
and when the troops told off for the actual storm broke cover
there was practically nothing in front to stop them. We carried
the place almost at the first rush; then ensued many long hours
of wood fighting, and at the fall of night our outposts finally held
the line, Dugny, Le Bourget, Raincy, Neuilly. Many of the
officers had been there before. We are now within easy bombarding
range of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>As I write a report comes in that great fires are raging in

<p class='c011'>At length we have great news to report from the British
Army. A great battle has been fought and won. Nay, more—the
whole Russian Army in Bulgaria, caught like rats in a trap,
has, after two days of fierce fighting, laid down its arms. It will
be seen, therefore, that the British Army has, after all, not turned
up in Asia Minor, but in Bulgaria. All the rumours and apparent
demonstrations which led to the belief that a great campaign in
Asia Minor was intended, were merely designed to distract attention
from the real objects of the expedition. Those who are
familiar with Lord Wolseley’s methods now profess to have been
always made suspicious by the fact that, as we reported in our
issue of June 4th, he had been talking a great deal of the advantages
of a campaign in Asia Minor. They say that it is notorious
that he holds strongly to the belief that what is supposed in your
own army to be about to happen will soon be believed by the
enemy. He succeeded in this way in imposing on Arabi so completely
during the ’82 campaign, that (extraordinary as it may
appear) the Egyptian leader was a prisoner in Ceylon, when he was
for the first time made acquainted with the great movement of the
English expedition from Alexandria to Ismalia. Lord Wolseley
then succeeded in deceiving Arabi because he had imposed upon
the world at large, although precisely in a similar manner he had,
by spreading reports of a call from Captain Glover during the
Ashantee campaign, managed to embark his troops for the surprise
of the coast towns from which the Ashantees were drawing their
supplies, without any one suspecting the direction in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>was going to strike. The former ruse had been forgotten, and
caused no suspicion as to the second. If we may judge by the
comments of our contemporaries on the reports which have been
hitherto furnished of the war, they have been either very discreet
and loyal, or have been completely bamboozled. And yet it was
tolerably plain that the direction in which an English Army
could at the moment be most effectively employed was in clearing
Bulgaria of the aggressive force of Russians, which, from the
peculiar circumstances of the case, she had not force to dispose of
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing that it is immediately in behalf of Bulgaria, and only
secondarily in behalf of Turkey, because of the support she had
offered to Bulgaria, that we were engaged in the struggle, there
was, independently of the military advantages of the movement,
an important political object to be gained by exercising our
strength at once in support of the gallant Bulgarian forces. Even
if it had been altogether politically convenient to allow the
Turkish Army to enter Bulgaria and move upon Tirnova and
Shumla, the material obstacles in the way were very serious. On
the other hand, twenty-four hours’ easy steaming would bring our
troops to the place at which the Russians had originally landed.
It was almost certain that as soon as the Russian General found
that our ships had again cut his communications by sea, he
would abandon his attempt to move upon Sofia and endeavour to
make good his retreat by the Dobrudja. From Kavarna we could
easily cut across such a movement, which it was to be hoped that
the Roumanians would endeavour to delay by every means in
their power. It appears that Lord Wolseley, all the time that he
was at Constantinople, was in full and direct communication with
the Bulgarian Generals, and that all movements were concerted
in connection with them; while the Roumanians, assured of
English support both by sea and land, were ready to do their
utmost to hamper the Russian movements should any attempt be
made, either from north or south, to force the passage of the
Dobrudja.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Without entering into further details, it will be sufficient to
say that Lord Wolseley’s delay at Constantinople was mainly in
order to receive the very latest reports from Bulgaria as to the
exact position and movements of the Russian Army. From the
nearest point on the coast to which telegraphic communication
has been carried from Constantinople swift dispatch boats were
to bring off the cypher messages, either to the fleet or to Kavarna,
whence, as the army advanced inland, the news would be carried.
A second line of communication was also established by way of
Kustenjeh and Bucharest. Thus the General had the great
advantage of knowing more precisely than would usually be the
case what the exact movements of his enemy were. To a certain
extent those movements were tied. Detachments of too large
force to be left to take their fate had been placed to watch
Shumla and Varna. From the reports which reached Lord
Wolseley, it was clear that the Russians having broken up their
camp at Tirnova were marching by way of Shumla—either intending
to call in their detachment from Varna and move from Shumla
direct upon the Dobrudja, or to advance upon Varna.</p>

<p class='c011'>In either case, an immediate landing at Kavarna would apparently
be out of reach of any serious disturbance from the
Russian forces until the landing was effected, and was extremely
likely to tempt the Russians to move to attack us in that position.
In that case, if we were only able to hold our own in a position
already examined and surveyed, it was probable that our force
would be amply sufficient to deal with the Russians, even alone,
and that within forty-eight hours the Bulgarians who had undertaken
to hang closely upon the Russian rear, might be expected
to arrive and make the position of the Russians impossible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately after the ships had passed out of sight of land,
the whole fleet changed its course to the N.-N.-West—and by
mid-day following that on which the fleet had left the Bosphorus
the greater portion of it was in the bay which extends from
Kaliakra Cape towards Varna.</p>

<p class='c011'>The landing had already been begun before our Correspondent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>arrived—but he was fortunate enough to be allowed to join
Colonel French’s Hussars, who were landed soon after it was
ascertained that the debarkation of the troops would meet with
no immediate resistance. This regiment was pushed southwards,
supported by a body of mounted infantry under Colonel Hutton,
the second day after the arrival of the troops, and as soon as
possible a couple of Horse Artillery guns, which were accompanied
by Colonel Marshall, with a small cavalry escort were sent
after them in support. The orders for the cavalry were to ascertain
the condition of affairs at Varna; if possible to capture a
few prisoners, and, taking advantage of the friendliness of the
inhabitants, to endeavour to obtain reports of the movements of
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our Correspondent’s description of this march is most interesting
and graphic, but we must abridge it in order to come to
greater events. It will be sufficient to say that they ascertained
that the Russian headquarters had arrived near Shumla without
having had any news of the landing of the English Army. The
Russian Army was moving on Varna. The Varna force had, however,
evidently received orders to make an attempt, if possible, to
induce the town to surrender. Just as the cavalry arrived on distant
hills within sight of the town, they saw a balloon hanging
over it. This at first gave them some anxiety lest their movements
might be watched, and their position discovered. In a
short time, however, they had reason to perceive that the balloon
was there for a very different purpose. A sight, as our Correspondent
describes it, at once appalling and magnificent met
their view. A black mass of some kind was seen to drop from
the balloon; as it about reached the level of the tallest buildings
in the place it suddenly burst into a lurid glare which lighted up
the minarets and pinnacles of the old Turkish town. Its course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>was marked by crashing buildings and falling ruins. It was
evidently a dynamite shell of vast proportions, which had been
deliberately dropped from the balloon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The object could only have been to terrorise the inhabitants
by a cruel and wanton destruction of property. If it had chanced
on a magazine it might have produced some effect upon the
defence. As it was, it could and did produce none. It indicated
to the Englishmen who watched it, rather the parting attempt of
Russian hopelessness than a serious effort of war. Nevertheless,
a tremendous cannonade was simultaneously opened from all the
works near the town, and was not put an end to until some of
our ships, which had maintained communication with the
garrison, closed in, to within range of the works, and though at a
considerable distance threw such a mass of shells against the
Russian field-guns that they were glad to cease their fire and
withdraw.</p>

<p class='c011'>We give in our Correspondent’s words the next scene. ‘Not
so, however, the balloon. To our amazement we saw it deliberately
change its course over the town and steer in teeth of the
wind, which was at the time a comparatively light breeze setting
seawards. As it reached the position which it was evidently
seeking—nearly over the magazines of Varna—we again saw
another shell drop out of the balloon, and as it burst on reaching
the buildings, what seemed like a universal conflagration of all
that part of the town, accompanied by frightful detonations and
explosions, showed the effect it had produced.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Colonel Marshall was standing next me at the moment, and
exclaimed, “Good God! I will tell you what it is; I remember
hearing, just before I left England, from an engineer named Delmard,
that the French were in possession of a war balloon capable of
being steered backwards and forwards even against a light wind,
and that they had an arrangement by which a particular form of
shell, with a steel casing and some arrangement of liquid oxygen
and blasting gelatine, could be dropped from the balloon. They
expected great results from it, and must evidently, as a special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>favour to the Russians, have sent this specimen of the thing over
to them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The evening sun had long set in the direction of Shumla. A
crescent moon had risen, and some brilliant stars shone in the
sky. As we looked over the undulating ground which separated
us from the burning town, the flames lighted up the ships in the
offing to the east, making a picture difficult indeed adequately to
represent.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘One thing, however, was clear to us, that the attention of the
force round Varna would be entirely occupied by the attempt to
take advantage of the destruction they had produced, which, disastrous
as it was for the inhabitants, did not seem likely, as far as
we could judge, to enforce any surrender.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The cavalry, finding themselves not observed, maintained
their position for the following day, sending scouting parties in all
directions, and reporting to headquarters.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This was the evening of the third day since the debarkation
had begun. Another cavalry regiment, with the remainder of the
Horse Artillery battery, had been sent up to support us; and
early the following morning Lord Wolseley, with several of his
Staff, including Sir Baker Russell, who is in command of the
Cavalry Division, joined us. About 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> I was looking down
over the plain, when I saw two Bulgarian peasants apparently in
fierce altercation, coming up towards the position where we were,
escorted by one of the Hussars, who was vainly endeavouring to
make himself intelligible to them. Presently they came in, one
of them holding up a letter in his hand. One of the interpreters
with Lord Wolseley in a short time made out their story. It
appeared that a Russian officer, who had missed his way, had
been seized and murdered by the villagers in the place to which
these two men belonged. One of the Hussars had found them in
possession of certain property of this officer, and had noticed
that a bag of letters was part of it. Being an intelligent fellow,
he had managed to make them understand that they should
accompany him to Colonel French. The letter the man was holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>up proved to be one of no importance, but it was only intended
as an indication of the purpose for which he had come. His companion
had what was evidently an officer’s sabretash, and on this
being opened, several letters were found in it, evidently dispatched
from the Russian headquarters to the commandant of
the force before Varna. It informed him of the fact that the
English troops, which were reported to have entered the Black
Sea, were believed in Russia at the latest news to have all gone
on towards Trebizonde. It informed him further that the Russian
General proposed to make a direct march to the Dobrudja, and
gave him the different halting points on the march. It informed
him of the point at which he was to join the march, and told him
that the greater part of the Cossacks and the remainder of the
Russian cavalry would be required to watch the Bulgarian force,
which, though inferior to the Russians, and at some marches distant,
might be expected to follow up their retreat. It would therefore
be necessary for the rather considerable cavalry force which was
attached to the troops at Varna to protect the right flank, and to
watch the advance of the main army when it arrived. Without
troubling your readers with the very ample information which
this dispatch conveyed, I may say generally that the period at
which the Russian Army, marching in two columns along two
roads at some distance from one another, would arrive at about
the level of Kosluji with its left column, was still about four days
off. All this information we received later. At the moment I
saw Lord Wolseley carefully reading through the translation of
the dispatches as it was put into his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Admiral Markham had ridden out with the party, and the first
person to whom Lord Wolseley turned, after he finished, was the
Admiral. A short discussion took place between them, the nature
of which I did not at the moment hear, but which I have reason
to believe related to the question of the amount of transport and
supplies that could be landed in the next day or two. At all
events, it was evident to all of us in a very short time that the
plans had been changed. Orders were immediately issued for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>march that afternoon of the three brigades which had first landed;
fortunately they were in the neighbourhood of Baltjik, so
that they were the nearest to Varna. The Cavalry, with the
mounted Infantry, were at once brought up, and extended so
as to cut off all communication between the main Russian Army
and Varna.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Fortunately the country in this neighbourhood consists of a
series of undulating uplands, with numbers of features permitting
the concealment of large bodies of men.’</p>

<p class='c011'>To tell the story as we now know it from various sources, the
opportunity which presented itself to Lord Wolseley’s mind as he
read the intercepted dispatch was just this. It was evident from
the information brought in by the Bulgarians, and from other
sources, that the Russians were still ignorant that an English
force had landed in the country. If he could immediately surprise
the camp at Varna, he would have at least a highly probable
opportunity of breaking in upon the Russian columns on their
march, and annihilating one before the other could come to its
support; especially seeing that they were relying upon the Cavalry
of the Varna force to cover their movements. This was a far
more brilliant opportunity than that which had been at first hoped
for when the taking up a position, which would oblige the Russians
to attack, had been designed. The intention was for the three
Infantry brigades to move up that night in two marches into a
position within reach of attack of the Russian camp at Varna,
and actually to make the attack at grey dawn on the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Charles Beresford was, according to arrangement, to land
in the evening with no particular attempt at concealment with a
party of Blue Jackets and Marines, and to arrange with the
Bulgarian Officer in command at Varna, for a sally of the whole
Bulgarian garrison so as to attract the attention of the Russians
towards the Varna side at the moment when our attack was made.
Watches having been carefully compared, three o’clock in the morning
was fixed upon as the hour for the simultaneous attack. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>three brigades were to attack respectively the right, left, and
centre of the Russian position.</p>

<p class='c011'>A powerful force of Artillery was kept back about two miles
from Varna in a favourable position in order to give support to
our troops in the event of any disaster. But it was to be a pure
Infantry attack, not a gun was to be fired, unless any of our troops
were forced to retreat. The sole duty of the Cavalry was to cut
off fugitives and prevent any knowledge of what had happened
from reaching the Russian General.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have reason to believe that some of the inhabitants brought
off by the fleet had supplied Lord Wolseley with most accurate
information as to the nature of the ground in the neighbourhood
of the Russian camp, and that this had given him considerable
confidence in arranging the details of the attack. Sir Evelyn
Wood had charge of the whole of the actual attack, and very great
advantage was found to arise from the practice in night marching
which had been carried out under his orders at Aldershot.</p>

<p class='c011'>It cannot, however, be said that the fighting on this occasion
was a very severe trial for our troops. The British Army had to
all intents and purposes dropped from the clouds upon the
Russians before they were aware of its arrival. No very serious
preparations had been made to resist attack from the north since
there was no reason to anticipate troops coming from that side.
The surprise the following morning was complete. That is to say,
not that the Russians were caught in their beds, but that the
English troops fully organised and ready for the attack were upon
them, and into their lines, before the Russians had been able to
prepare any organised resistance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only on one side, where an active Russian General had
cautiously entangled the front of his position with obstacles, was
the right brigade checked for a time, and, though some losses were
occasioned here, the general effect of the attack on all sides of the
Russian position, and the numerous places in which the works had
been entered made it impossible for the troops who had resisted
the attack of the right Brigade to hold out for any length of time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>The Russians fought most gallantly, yet showed very little power
of acting for themselves in a case where superior orders could not
reach them.</p>

    <div>THE RELIEF OF VARNA.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By noon the whole of the works were in our hands, and as the
Cavalry intercepted all who attempted to make their escape, the
Mounted Infantry holding all such places as were inconvenient
for the Cavalry, we had every reason to believe that no one had
escaped to tell the tale. The slaughter on neither side was very
great, the Russian position being, from the beginning, so obviously
hopeless, greatly outnumbered and surprised as they were, that
nearly 10,000 men laid down their arms. The prisoners were the
following day embarked for Constantinople, considerable supplies
and very valuable transport waggons, horses, and mules fell into
our hands. To make assurance doubly sure, Lord Wolseley had
brought up a fourth of Sir Evelyn Wood’s brigades nearly to the
position occupied by the batteries. Meantime, on the same
morning that the fight was going on, nearly the whole of the
remainder of the force had marched to occupy the high lands which
overlook the two roads leading up from Kosluji and Varna upon
Bazardjik.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was evident that, assuming the march of the Russians to be
carried out in accordance with the captured dispatch, the two
Russian columns would, during a certain period of their march, be
not only some ten miles apart, but be separated by some very
difficult country. And, moreover, that as the roads converged
towards Bazardjik, an English force occupying the uplands would
have its two portions much closer together than the advancing
Russians. A valuable capture of the papers of the Russian General
in command at Varna showed that a duplicate of the intercepted
dispatch had reached him the previous day. Apparently a reply
had been prepared, but none as yet sent off. This indicated the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>movements he was intending to adopt in order to join the main
force. As it had been ascertained that Kosluji, though not as yet
in the possession of the Russians, was in telegraphic communication
with the Russian headquarters, it was resolved to repair
the telegraph, which had only been cut by the peasants between
Kosluji and Varna. As soon as this was done a telegraphic
dispatch was sent through in the Russian cypher to the General
commanding, ‘Yours of the 10th, Cavalry will be pushed on to
cover right flank, and advance of army on Bazardjik. The
Infantry and Artillery will join rear of column after the right
column has passed the junction.’ The British forces were now
distributed as follows: Of the Duke of Connaught’s Corps, the
right division occupied the high ground which the road from
Kosluji towards Bazardjik crosses shortly after passing Kosluji.
The second division similarly occupied the high ground above the
Varna-Bazardjik road. The Artillery of the entire army was
concentrated on the high ground in such a way as to be able to
bring its fire upon the columns debouching from the roads. The
whole of Sir Evelyn Wood’s Corps lay in a position between Varna
and the high ground, ready to attack the right column as soon as
its march should be sufficiently developed to give an opportunity.
Advantage had been taken of the number of captured Russian
uniforms in the camp at Varna to put up dummy sentries, so as
to leave the impression from a distance that Varna encampment
and neighbourhood was still held by the Russians. The whole of
the ground over which the fight was likely to take place was
carefully reconnoitred beforehand. On the morning of June 14th
the Russian right column, which, having a considerably longer
march to perform, moved off first, had arrived at the point where
the road turns sharply to the north leading towards Bazardjik,
when a party of Cossacks, who had been sent on to communicate
with the cavalry from Varna, which was supposed to be before
them on the road, galloped in and reported that they had been
stopped on the road in crossing the mountains by finding that the
path was blocked with some felled trees and abattis. Supposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>this to be the work of some Bulgarian insurgents, the General
ordered forward a battalion of Infantry and a couple of guns, and
allowed the column to resume the march. Shortly afterwards
some Cossacks who had moved towards Varna rode up to some
supposed friends in Russian uniform, were captured, and not
allowed to return. No alarm therefore was excited on this side.
As, however, the battalion of Infantry moved up to the abattis in
order to remove it, they were fired upon by unseen foes, and many
of them fell. A brigade was now ordered to advance and clear
the ground. As it moved forward within close range of the hills
it, too, was received with Infantry fire from unseen foes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The dispatch from our Correspondent of June 18th, published
last week, stopped abruptly at the moment of describing how the
column of Russians was advancing into the ambush cleverly laid
for them by Lord Wolseley. In the following dispatch he continues
the narrative:—</p>

<p class='c011'>As yet not a shot had been fired by the artillery or by any of
Sir Evelyn Wood’s troops, whose position was absolutely unknown.
The column was now halted in considerable confusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The General commanding the Russian brigade, uncertain as to
what he had in front of him, did not like to commit himself to an
attack without previous preparation by artillery, and asked to
have some artillery sent him. Six batteries were brought out in
succession from the column on the road at a gallop, and began to
shell the heights.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncertain as to what they were firing at, they produced very
little effect, and none of the guns on the hills replied to them.
Meantime the column on the road was in the greatest confusion.
A fresh brigade was, however, gradually formed out of it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>moved up towards the right of the road. A third brigade was to
be seen also moving up in support of the other two. As the right
brigade moved up in successive lines towards the heights, its right
came within easy range of the position in which, concealed behind
a long line of under-feature, Sir Evelyn Wood’s advanced division
lay. When the rear of the brigade had fairly passed beyond his
left, a withering volley, followed by magazine fire, was poured
into it from the whole line of the division.</p>

<p class='c011'>Staggered by the unexpected blow, the brigade fell into confusion.
Sir Evelyn, seizing the moment, advanced the whole
division, having given orders beforehand that the men should be
kept in hand as much as possible; and that instead of a skirmishing
attack, which was quite unnecessary under the circumstances,
lines at least of companies should be kept together as much as
possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Russian brigade, though taken in rear as well as flank,
endeavoured for a moment to present a front in the new direction.
As they did so the guns from the high ground for the first time
opened, tearing through the Russian ranks in all directions.
Under the double storm, taken in flank whichever way they
turned, the brigade gave way, and was followed closely by the
leading division of Sir Evelyn’s Corps.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Russian brigade next on the left began immediately to
attempt to dig in order to form a rallying point for the flying
brigade, but, overwhelmed by the fugitives, fired into from the
heights, and pressed by the pursuing division, they too broke,
and carried confusion amongst the guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole of the troops that had debouched from the road
were now little better than a confused mass, unable to act with
effect, and suffering appallingly from the cross fire directed upon
them by Sir Evelyn’s troops and those on the hill, whose fire was
now continually increasing in intensity.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The remainder of the Corps, with little space to deploy, and
whelmed by the mass of fugitives, was huddled back upon the
road. At this moment a pre-concerted signal from Lord Wolseley
directed Sir Baker Russell, who with the whole of the cavalry,
less Colonel French’s regiment which was on the extreme right,
had been placed near Varna to the left of Sir Evelyn’s force, to
charge into the confused mass which now represented the right
corps of the Russian Army. Enormous numbers of prisoners
were taken, and sent back promptly to Varna to be embarked on
board ship. Meantime the left Corps of the Russian Army had
begun its advance along the other road towards Bazardjik, but
before it approached the heights the news of the disaster which
had befallen the right corps reached the General. Though at
first his intention had been to attempt to out-flank the position
opposed to him on the English right, in order to relieve the pressure
on his own right, the rapid progress of the disaster of the
right made him change his determination. With his intact Corps
he took up a position to cover the retreat of the remnants of the
broken Corps. Practically only one English division, besides the
cavalry, had been seriously engaged. From the nature of the case
the losses had been comparatively small. Smokeless powder had
told altogether in favour of the English in the action.</p>

<p>MAP OF THE FIGHT NEAR VARNA.<br /><br />Facsimile of Sketch from our War Correspondent.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Practically the fate of the Russian army was decided. Lord
Wolseley was in full communication with the Bulgarian General,
who, with a force between forty and fifty thousand strong, had
been following close upon the heels of the Russians. There could
be no hope that, with their diminished and discouraged troops, the
Russians would be able to defeat the English forces, against which
with their intact army they had failed on the previous day. Nor
could they turn on the Bulgarians without having both armies
upon them at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>To avoid useless slaughter, the Russian General forty-eight
hours later agreed to lay down his arms. As soon as the Russian
army had given up its guns and was no longer in a position to act
effectively, the English army marched back to the coast, and,
according to our latest information, a considerable part of it
had already embarked and sailed in an unknown direction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Wolseley, with Admiral Markham and their Staffs, have
returned to Constantinople, doubtless in order to be in communication
with Ministers at home, the Ambassador, the Sultan,
and other sources of information. It is only fair to a gallant
enemy to say that the startling success which has attended our
arms is, apart from the gallantry of our soldiers and the skill
of the General who led them, to be attributed to the enormous
advantage which is possessed by the Power that commands the
sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the moment that our fleet cut off the communications of
the Russian Army, the Russian General was in a position, such as
in our time can rarely happen, of being completely deprived of all
means of knowing what his enemy was doing, while, on the other
hand, our own Commander was able to obtain information far more
accurate than is common in war of everything that his opponent
did. No other Power in Europe could have reached and destroyed
with the same ease and certainty that dangerous Russian force,
susceptible of indefinite increase, as long as Russia held the sea.
Meantime, speculation is rife as to the direction in which our
army is next going to strike.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For the past two days the entire populace of this city has
lived in a state of frenzied excitement, to which the seething
clamour of the days immediately following the memorable 15th
September 1882 is only faintly comparable. Then it was, with
the arrival before the gate of the citadel of Sir Drury Lowe and
his cavalry brigade fresh from Tel-el-Kebir, that England’s peaceful
occupation of Cairo began. There were no Europeans in Cairo at
the time, and even the better classes of Egyptians had either fled
to distant parts of the country or lay hidden in their spacious
houses, closely barred against intrusion by friend or foe. Demonstration
of popular feeling was confined to the astounded and
panic-ridden natives of the lower orders, whose bewildered minds
swung for a week between fearful anticipation of the horrors they
had been taught to expect at the hands of the English, and trembling
delight that the reign of terror under Arabi and Toulba had
at length come to an end. They needed time, these stricken,
starving people, to discover the state of their feelings; to decide
whether they were pleased that foreign aid had come to them, or
were only glad to know that Arabi had fled, and would soon be in
prison; and in their indecision, for two whole days and nights
dense crowds of wandering Arabs, Fellaheen, street merchants,
clerks, donkey-boys, and small officials, thronged the European
quarters of the town, ceaselessly jostling each other through the
streets, and murmuring repeatedly, ‘The English have come. The
Effendina is coming.’</p>

<p class='c011'>That was ten years ago. During those ten years the English
soldiers and the Cairenes, both natives and foreigners, have learned
so well to know and appreciate each other, that when it leaked
out (who shall say how) on Sunday evening that orders had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>received for the immediate embarkation of all the British troops
in garrison here, the announcement clanged like a tocsin through
the startled town.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once again the Frank quarter was filled with an anxious
wondering mob, formed not of Arabs only, but of all the varied
nationalities that make up Cairo’s thriving population, who
roamed the broad streets round the Esbekeeyeh Gardens, silent,
orderly, and sad, or gathered in tight-packed masses in front of
Shepheard’s and the New Hotel, and the Sporting Club, and lingered
for hours in slowly changing thousands in the great square
facing the Abdeen barracks.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was near midnight, and the moon was high, when the news
became generally known. The band of the Alexandria Regiment
had for some time ceased playing in the Esbekeeyeh Gardens, and
nearly all English soldiers were back in barracks. Some few men,
however, who had twelve o’clock leave, were still abroad, and as, on
their way home, they shouldered through the throng—wondering,
no doubt, what could be the matter—they were instantly seized
upon by scores of eager well-wishers, delighted to find an outlet
for some portion of the cordial enthusiasm pent up within them.
Of one of these spontaneous outbursts of affection towards
‘Thomas Atkins’ I was myself a witness. I was standing with
other Englishmen and ladies on Shepheard’s balcony watching
the shifting masses of the crowd below, when suddenly there
arose, some way up the street—beyond the British Consulate—a
wild confused noise of cheering. It was a queer kind of cheer,
such as could probably be heard nowhere else in the world—a
strange blending of the Zughareet of Arab women—the guttural
Fellah Hàgh, the Italian Viva, and the Greek Huzzah, with a
leavening of Levantine squeal; but the outcome of the mixture
was sufficiently startling to make us turn—for a moment anxiously—in
the direction of the sound. Then the crowd before us took
up the cry, and quickly pressing back on either side of the way,
left room for the passage of the most extraordinary procession it
has yet fallen to my lot to behold.</p>

sleeves flaunting as they waved their arms, and their gold-broidered
waistcoats gleaming bravely in the moonlight. Their usual cry of
‘<em>Shmarlek, Gemeelek</em>,’ was interrupted now by hoarse shouts of
‘Inglis, Inglis, long live the Inglis!’—shouts which the crowd
readily took up. Immediately behind them paced a tall, half-naked
negro, who—such is the length to which enthusiasm will
carry these fanatics—held outstretched before him (a sacrifice to
friendship), his brawny right arm transfixed by a long knife, from
whose blade his blood dripped freely to the ground. A carriage
followed—an ordinary hack victoria, captured, doubtless, close
by—round which a frenzied mob surged, yelling and gesticulating
madly. There was no driver on the carriage. The box-seat was
occupied by a mandolin player and a harpist, whose fingers were
very busy, though of their music not one note could be heard. In
the victoria were the objects of the demonstration, two English
soldiers, one of whom, while preserving his good temper, was
struggling manfully though vainly against a dozen pair of hands
that held him in his place, and loudly declaring in words as
unavailing as they were forcible that he was due in barracks
at midnight and could not ‘stay fooling’ any later. His protest
was disregarded, and his comrade, who had apparently succumbed
to the hospitality of a burly Greek who faced the pair,
on the Strapontin, nursing a huge demijohn of some pernicious
liquor, gave him no help, expressing neither approval nor
condemnation of the proceedings, and, indeed, but for the tender
ministrations of an old äalem in a saffron robe, who stood on
the step beside him, he would probably have fallen out into the
road.</p>

<p class='c011'>The motley carnival passed slowly into the night; the shouts
softened in the distance and then died away; but the crowd,
silent again, remained staring vacantly at the hotel windows. As
I turned from the balcony railings a quiet native spectator on the
pavement beneath me looked up and spoke in Arabic: ‘Ah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Hawaga,’ he said, ‘Toufik Pasha has gone; Allah rest him! Now
the English are going—evil days are coming.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Throughout Sunday night and during the whole of yesterday
the great crowd filled the streets. Even the announcement made
yesterday afternoon that, although the English soldiers were called
suddenly away, their Indian brothers-in-arms would replace them,
failed to satisfy the public mind, or to remove the painful impression
it had received. In some vague way the feeling of the native
populace was that, though the Indian troops might be soldiers of
England’s Queen, they were not the English they had known; the
English who wore yellow clothes, and blue goggles, and hats with
towels on them, and who paid so well for donkey hire, and bought
so freely in the bazaars, and were so easily persuaded to accept
bits of imported blue glass as valuable turquoises, ‘and wonderfully
cheap.’</p>

<p class='c011'>With very few exceptions all British troops were confined to
barracks yesterday—not so much on account of their preparations
for departure, for ever since the reinforcement of the garrison the
commanders of regiments have been held in readiness to entrain
in two hours after receipt of orders—but in order to avoid the
repetition, on probably a very large scale, of Sunday night’s demonstrations.
The natives, therefore, were fain to be content with
standing in thousands outside the barrack-yard gates gazing at
the busy scene within, while from time to time some English-speaking
donkey-boy would accost the impassive sentries on behalf
of himself and friends with some such speech as, ‘You going,
Missa Soja, Arab prenty solly.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Thanks to the energy and foresight of the Commander-in-Chief
in carefully policing the whole length of the canal with troops
from Suez to Port Said to prevent any such apt accident as the
sinking of a dredger in a narrow part, the transports suffered no
delay. Each ship—there were eight (chartered vessels of the P.
and O., British India and Orient Lines)—on reaching Suez landed
the troops she had brought from Bombay and passed on into the
Canal, employing the time of her passage in cleaning up for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>reception of the English regiments at Alexandria. The Indian
brigades are for the moment encamped on the Sweet Water Canal,
pending dispatch to their several stations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The British troops were entrained to-day at noon. Two
Soudanese and one Egyptian regiment lined the entry to the
railway station as a guard of honour. The young Khedive himself,
accompanied by his brother, Mehemet Ali Bey, and followed by
Zulfikar Pasha and many of the court functionaries, drove to the
station to bid them farewell, and arriving a few moments before
the first of the departing regiments, caused his carriage to be so
placed that the men must march past it. As each regiment
passed him, His Highness, who had alighted and stood beside the
victoria, saluted, and said repeatedly ‘Good-bye, gentlemen,’ in
English. To entrain the troops took, of course, some little time,
and the —— remained a while in the small square outside the
station while their comrades were taking their places in the
coaches. His Highness, who looked very grave and had spoken
but briefly with Sir Evelyn Baring and other English gentlemen
present, had entered his carriage, and the sayces had leapt to their
places before it, when suddenly a voice shouted, ‘Three cheers for
Abbas Pasha.’ Who the enthusiast was I do not care to guess;
but the cry was taken up eagerly. Despite discipline, despite
etiquette, against propriety even though it was, a mighty cheer
burst from the waiting troops round the royal carriage, and was
echoed from within the station with redoubled volume.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Khedive seemed for a moment overcome. Then he drove
quickly away. The farewell of the native populace to the troops
as they marched through the streets was pathetic in its earnestness.
By a purely spontaneous motion all Cairo had gathered wherever
it could to wish the Englishmen ‘God go with you.’ The passage
of the regiments was marked by innumerable incidents showing
the affection in which the men were held and the genuine distress
of the people at their loss. A typical instance of this native
enthusiasm is worth recording. In the —— regiment—I purposely
avoid naming it—for some time quartered in the Citadel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>is a turbulent giant known as ‘Mad Donald’—a long service man,
greatly liked, known for gallantry in the field, and steady enough
on parade; but who has twice lost his stripes for drunkenness.
For he is not content to be passively drunk, but must also be
violent. Under the influence of alcohol destruction becomes his
ruling passion. In his periodical outbursts Donald has been a
terror to the many street merchants whose displays of fragile wares
cumber the Er Rumeyleh Square, at the head of the Mooskee.
He has overturned their tables, made wholesale havoc of their
goods, and fought the crowd with the trestles of the spoiled. His
chief enemy and victim has been an old dealer in gaudy crockery
and glass ornaments, whose entire stock he has several times
reduced to shivers, and then danced upon the wreck, defying the
police. Yet to-day as the —— marched by, with stalwart Donald
leading man of his company, this old man dragged his table
forward, crying, ‘Ya, Donal; ya, Donal; break something for luck’—and
was quite distressed at the tall soldier’s smiling disregard.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the last train had steamed out of the station the
immense concourse of people who, on either side of the line, had
for an hour yelled farewells, fell once more to silently pacing the
streets, where they still remain at this late hour. I have been for
long among them and am forced to say that what was indicated to
me on Sunday night by one man is now the prevailing sentiment
of the multitude, ‘The English have gone—the Effendina will go
soon—evil days are coming.’</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>You have heard from other sources of Sir F. Grenfell’s reappointment
to the command in Egypt, and of the fact that he
had undertaken that, if a certain number of Indian troops were
sent to him, he would be responsible for the safety of Egypt,
although all the garrison then in occupation was sent to join the
Eastern Expedition. My last letter from Alexandria informed
you of the departure of these troops. I may add that the Brigade
of Indian troops sent to our support had landed two days previously
at Suez, and had been moved up to Cairo during my
absence. Yesterday they marched past the Khedive in the square
of the Abdeen palace. Their splendid appearance recalled the
impression which had been produced by the contingent from
India which had in the same square marched past the former
Khedive after the campaign of 1882.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have heard of the arrival of the English fleet and part of
the expedition at Constantinople, and are anxiously awaiting
further news.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have, however, little time for reading. Our troubles at home
give us plenty of occupation. The European population of Cairo is
made up mainly of Germans, Italians, Greeks, French, and English.
The French, to whose ranks are added Coptic, Armenian, and Levantine
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</span></i> and sympathisers, greatly outnumber any of the other
nationalities, and, with some noteworthy exceptions, are not very
estimable representatives of their nation. To preserve peace and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>order among these excitable peoples, whose countrymen are all
cutting one another’s throats at home, is no light task, and has,
despite the precautions taken, occasionally proved too much for all
the powers of diplomacy, even when backed by General Baker
Pasha’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gendarmerie</span></i>. On the first rumour of war Sir Evelyn
Baring and his colleagues, fully appreciating the dangers of the
situation, formed themselves, with some leading citizens, into an
International Peace Committee, of which the Prime Minister is
chairman, and agreed on various measures for the preservation of
tranquillity in the community. The first of these measures (and
subsequent events have shown its necessity) was the general
prohibition to Arabs and Europeans alike, from carrying weapons
of any kind (including walking-sticks or umbrellas) in the streets
of Cairo or Alexandria. In 1882, between the time (11th June)
of the Arab rising and the bombardment (11th July), a like
prohibition did good service in Alexandria; but now, despite its
rigorous enforcement, there have already been several fierce
encounters between the hot-blooded French and Italians. The
new French Consul-General, I am forced to say, has given no help
to the Peace Committee, and has rather made it his business to
frustrate their counsels and mar their plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>A very clever French journal, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Dernière Nouvelle</span></cite>, published
since the opening of the war, which daily prints marvellous accounts
of British, German, and Italian defeats, is notoriously concocted in
its entirety within the four walls of the French Legation. There
are, indeed, no Frenchmen in the community outside of these walls
capable of producing at once so witty and so scurrilous a sheet, or
one so entirely dependent for its news on the imagination of its
editors. Their reports are accepted by their own readers. None of
the more accurate accounts from other sources are believed. But the
arrogance and aggressive attitude of the French colony and Consul-General,
the vicious blatherings of <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Dernière Nouvelle</span></cite>, the nightly
chanting by turbulent members of the French community outside
Shepheard’s Hotel and the British Legation of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Malbrouque s’enfuit
du Caire; On ne l’y verra plus</span>,’ and kindred versions of old songs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>adapted to the requirements of the moment, together with the
breaking of some dozens of English and Italian heads in dark byways
and noisy taverns, are, after all, but minor matters, and very
trivial as compared with the rumours of impending trouble that
reach us from the southern frontier. Our news from the Nile
outposts is grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Khalifa Abdullah Taashi and the Emir Osman Khalid
Zogal, who commands at Dongola, have long been in communication
with Cairo. Indeed—since we are at war with France, it
may as well be said—for years it has been known in well-informed
circles here, that leading members of the French colony were in
constant, though, thanks to General Grenfell’s vigilance, irregular,
correspondence with the Khalifa’s officers. Thus there is no doubt
that the Khalifa has been informed of the withdrawal of the
English troops from Egypt, and of their replacement by Indian
regiments. He has probably been assured that, owing to the
general conflict in Europe, Egypt can in no event hope for further
reinforcements from England. His opinion of the fighting value
of Indian soldiers is presumably low. The only operations in
which Indian troops have taken part in the Soudan were those
near Suakim in March 1885 (M<sup>c</sup>Neil’s Zareba and the Battle of
Hasheen); and Osman Digna, in his written reports to the Mahdi,
claimed these engagements as decided victories for the Ansar.
The Khalifa, therefore, with some degree of reason, considers the
moment opportune for a descent on Egypt in force, and for this
descent he is making preparations on a large scale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Colonel Wodehouse, who is at Wady Halfa, reports the existence
at Ginnis of a new Mahdist camp, formed within the past month,
which now numbers from six to seven thousand Tokuls. On the
west bank, a smaller camp is being formed at Dal. The Arabs daily
scout in numbers right up to Sarras and to the fort at Khor Moussa,
on which they fire nightly. Saleh Bey, the Sheikh of the Abadeh
tribe, whose duty it is to guard the eastern desert between Korosko
and the Wells of Murat, has reported that last week, having news
of preparations for a forward movement at Abu Hammid, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>occupied Murat with a body of 250 men. He was attacked on
the night of May 29th by a large force of horse and camel-men, and
after a hot engagement, in which he had 57 men killed and lost
108 camels, he was forced to abandon the Wells to the enemy and
retreat to the Bab-el-Korosko. The Murat Wells, he says, will
not supply a force of 500 men for more than three days, and he,
therefore, fears an advance on Ongat and Haimur. A small body
of Kababish tribesmen, the remnant of that once powerful clan
who, though for some time with the enemy, are still loyal, have
reached Halfa from Dongola, where they say great preparations
are being made for an advance. Daily small detachments of
Jehadieh and considerable bodies of Ansar arrive at Dongola from
Omdurman, and large supplies of provisions are being collected.
Three nuggars, laden with dhurra, were wrecked, they say, less
than a month ago, on the rocks near Barkhal. A good deal of
doubt attaches to this statement, but if it be true, it indicates a
very early rise of the Nile, for at this season, as a rule, the whole
140 miles of river from Abu Hammid to Barkhal is a veritable
maze of rock-strewn passages, impassable by even the smallest
boats. These tribesmen travelled by the west bank, and say that
from Dongola to Dal, the route was like that to a fair.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Sirdar starts for the front to-night, and kindly permits me
to accompany him. Colonel Kitchener expresses himself thoroughly
confident that his own troops are strong enough to cope with
any forces the enemy may bring to meet him; but a feeling of uneasiness
in some high quarters here, coupled may be with the fact
that troops at Halfa and Korosko have lately suffered severely from
influenza, has caused some pressure to be brought on him, with the
result that it has been decided that the 17th Bengal Native Infantry
and the 29th Beloochees are to act under his orders and co-operate
with the Egyptian forces if necessary. They were sent by train
to Assiout yesterday afternoon, and have already started for
Assouan, Mr. Cook having undertaken their transport in flat-bottomed
barges, towed by steamers of four feet draught. My
next letter will probably be from Wady Halfa.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The 17th Bengal Regiment reached here last night in four
barges towed by steamers, having made the distance in six days—without
accidents—and is encamped on the west bank, opposite
Halfa. The Beloochees, one of whose towing steamers ran aground
near Derr, occasioning seven hours’ delay, will probably be here
to-morrow. We are still in uncertainty as to the Arab plan of
attack. The state of the river between Sarras and Semneh has
prevented the use of the armed pinnace for reconnaissance
purposes, and, although the Egyptian Camel Corps has repeatedly
pushed forward along the west bank to within a few miles of Dal,
their Commander has been able to gain very little insight into the
enemy’s movements. It seems likely, however, that the Emir’s
attack will be made on the east bank, but against what point
between Sarras and Korosko it will be directed, there is as yet no
sufficient indication.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sheikh Mustapha Gibran, who, with 150 men, occupies the
Selima Oasis in the western desert some sixty miles inland
from Dal, reports that, with the exception of a party of some
fifty camp followers who came out to Selima in the beginning
of last week apparently to obtain salt, he has been unmolested.
On the east bank an attempt was made three days
ago, at a reconnaissance into the Batn-el-Hagar, or ‘Belly of Rock,’
which borders the river between Sarras and the wells at Ambigol,
forming an almost impassable barrier to troops. The enterprise
was near resulting in the annihilation of the reconnoitring
party; for the rocks were found to be full of Arabs, who sprang
up on every side to the attack. Fortunately their dash was made
too early, and Captain Beech was able to retire in good order, but
with a loss of four men. We expect, however, that a very few
days more will discover the tactics of the Emirs.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A decisive engagement was fought yesterday near this place,
with the result that after five hours of hard—in some cases of
desperate—fighting, during the course of which the issue was at
times uncertain, this latest tide of invasion has been rolled back
once more into the desert. The Arabs have suffered terrible loss.
Our own casualties, of which I have not as yet full particulars, are,
I regret to say, very considerable. The Arab attack was intended
to be a surprise, but this plan was partially defeated by one of
those simple accidents which occasionally upset the calculations
of commanding officers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving aside Assouan and Korosko, the defending forces in
and around Wady Halfa numbered, with details, medical staff,
bearer companies, etc., about 6500 officers and men. This is
without counting the navigating crews of the gunboats (armed
with Krupp and machine guns), or the Indian regiment still on its
way up the Nile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early the day before yesterday, Captain Beech, with a company
of the Camel Corps, pushed forward on the west bank to within
200 yards of Dal without touching the enemy. He reported Dal
abandoned by the fighting men (who had presumably crossed to
the east bank), and occupied only by several thousand women and
camp followers, who fled on his approach. The same evening the
Colonel commanding at Korosko, telegraphed news of an attack in
force on the Irregulars at the Bab-el-Korosko, to whose assistance
he had sent the 5th Battalion Egyptian Infantry.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost coincident with the receipt of this news was the
discovery of a large Arab force in the hills east of Halfa. A small
body of Cavalry, under Lieutenant Abd-el-Azrak, scouting at the
base of the hills, suddenly perceived two mounted men (on camels)
appear on a height, while, at the same moment, a shot was fired.
This was probably an accident, but it was evidently regarded as a
signal, for immediately, with a great shout, men sprang up everywhere
among the rocks. A heavy fire was opened upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Egyptians, and a body of some hundred Arabs was seen to dash
down a small scrub-clad khor towards the plain. Lieutenant
Abd-el-Azrak, who, in the first fire, had suffered a loss of two
horses killed and one trooper wounded, trotted back to Halfa (he
was not pursued), where the noise of firing had already announced
his discovery.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>SOUDANESE ATTACK UPON A RECONNOITRING PARTY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Sirdar at once made arrangements to meet the impending
attack. Deberra was advised of the news by telephone. The 7th
Battalion Egyptian Infantry was marched to Dabrosa to reinforce
the half-battalion there; Sarras was warned to keep up steam on
two engines, and hold the 11th Soudanese in readiness to
entrain if required; and, at the same time a pilot engine, accompanied
by half a squadron of Cavalry was sent forward to examine
the line. The enemy was apparently not ready, and, though he
would have had us at a disadvantage, delayed his attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>All night long we could hear the noggaras beaten in the Arab
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>bivouac, and the air was so still that even the voices of the Fikis
and their congregations wailing in prayer were plainly audible.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the grey of the dawn the Sirdar made a reconnaissance with
all mounted troops, and found the base of the first low range of
hills immediately opposite Halfa covered for a stretch of over a
mile with the enemy, whose irregular lines were sometimes two or
three, and sometimes a dozen or more, men deep. Behind them
the heights were thickly crowned with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rayas</span></i> (banners), which we
estimated at near a hundred in number (we afterwards found they
were eighty-seven). This implied that we had a force opposed to
us of near 10,000 Jehadieh (regulars), and probably at least half
as many Ansar.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rayas</span></i> was pointed out by a deserter as the green
banner of Ali Wad el Helu, while another was said to be that of
the Emir of Emirs, Abd el Maula el Taashi himself. On a height
near this banner the enemy had mounted a brass gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything being reported clear on the west bank, where for
miles no trace of an Arab force was to be seen, the Bengal
regiment was brought across the river at dawn in native boats,
and half-an-hour later the 11th Soudanese arrived from Sarras.
With the force thus at his disposal, in all some 4000 men, the
Sirdar decided to draw the enemy to an attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hills lie about four and a half miles east of Halfa, extending
for some distance in a line parallel with the river bank. For
about two miles, however, from the slopes, the ground is irregular,
much broken, filled with deep pits and sudden ledges which would
be as eminently suitable for the enemy’s favourite tactics as it
were unfavourable for operations of troops. The Sirdar, from the
position he had taken up at the beginning of this broken ground,
ordered forward the two guns of the Horse Battery, which opened
fire on the enemy’s position at 6.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> This soon had the
desired effect; the Arabs—after endeavouring to reply with their
gun, whose fire, owing to the long range and their defective
ammunition, was quite ineffective—formed into two columns,
preceded by a long straggling line of skirmishers, and advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>rapidly. The guns now retired a thousand yards, and the
mounted troops having poured (dismounted) a couple of volleys
into the advancing spearmen at 400 yards range, slowly retired,
still firing, on the artillery. This manœuvre was twice repeated
with every success, the well-directed fire of the guns doing considerable
execution in the enemy’s advancing host, while the
galling fire of the mounted troops irritated them to forgetfulness
of prudence. The fire of the Arab riflemen posted on the first
slopes of the hills and scattered in the broken ground at their
base did us less damage than it caused the enemy’s advancing
lines; but this did not appear to be noticed by the Arab commanders.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the Horse Artillery had reached a point some 2000
yards from the fort at Halfa, the Sirdar ordered out the 1st
Infantry Brigade, consisting of the Indian Regiment, the 12th
Soudanese, and the half-battalion 9th Soudanese, together with
the 1st and 2d Field Batteries (six guns in all).</p>

<p class='c011'>The mounted troops were then ordered to make a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</span></i> to
the north to prevent any portion of the enemy avoiding the
battle and advancing towards Deberra. At the same time, the
2d Brigade, consisting of the 11th Soudanese, the 7th Egyptian
Infantry, and half-battalion of the 1st Egpytian Infantry, were
ordered to advance from Dabrosa to check any movement towards
the river in that direction. The guns of Halfa Fort were able to
do good service in support of the 1st Brigade. Unfortunately the
height of the river banks rendered the gunboats useless until the
enemy should reach the Nile itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Arabs were fighting for water. Their long <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</span></i> round
the Batn-el-Hagar must have tried them severely, for though they
had probably found some springs in the hills, these would be
altogether insufficient for the wants of so large a force. When
they saw the disposition of the Sirdar’s troops they did not hesitate
for a moment. A force, roughly computed at about six
thousand men, of whom some two thousand were riflemen, and
the rest spear and swordsmen, dashed forward in a formation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>something like that of a Zulu impi upon the 1st Brigade, which
was at once formed into a square, with the guns about 200 yards
to its left rear. The Arabs made three attempts to rush the
square; but there was no cover for them in the open plain, and,
though in their second charge they succeeded in crushing in for a
moment, by sheer weight of numbers, the right front corner, the
half-battalion of the 9th Soudanese, which was in reserve, was
able to fill the gap and repulse the heavy mass of spearmen.
Their signal failure ultimately counselled them prudence. They
did not as yet recognise their defeat, but drew off into the broken
ground, where they maintained themselves for some time keeping
up an incessant galling fire upon our ranks, despite our efforts to
dislodge them, and making from time to time dashes in force
upon any point in our lines that seemed weak. We had literally
to hunt them from cover to cover in this broken ground, and, I fear,
suffered severely in the process, as the advantages were with
them. At length, however, after three hours’ desperate fighting,
they drew off to a position behind the first low range of hills, and
the brigade advancing poured volley after volley into their retreating
numbers; while the artillery shelled their position, with, as
we found afterwards, considerable effect. Meanwhile a second
body of Arabs in two divisions had made for the river bank, just
north of Dabrosa, at a point where, for a distance of some two
miles, palm groves and plantations, some hundred yards deep,
fringe the bank. While one division of spearmen hurled itself
against the 2d Brigade, which had advanced rapidly to meet it,
the other gained the plantation, from whose cover a heavy fire
was poured both on the 2d Brigade and on Dabrosa village. This
success was, however, only temporary. The gunboat <em>Abu Klea</em>
was able to bring its platform machine gun to bear on the plantation
with murderous effect; while, when he had repulsed the
division attacking him, which he did with great slaughter, Colonel
Wodehouse, commanding the 2d Brigade, detached a regiment to
rake the plantation from south to north; before whose fire some
thousand Arabs, the remnant of those who had gained this cover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>were speedily in hot retreat across the plain. These retreating
stragglers the mounted troops now steadily drove southward to
the hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was 1 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> before the day could be said to be ours. By this
time the whole plain was strewn with dead and wounded Arabs,
many of them in chain armour, many more in the parti-coloured
Mahdi uniform, not a few almost naked. When the Sirdar’s
forces occupied the first range of hills, we captured no less than
thirty-seven standards whose Emirs had presumably perished.
All the afternoon deserters came in from the enemy to give themselves
up. From some of these men we learned that the force
was commanded by Abd-el-Maula himself, and that among the
other high commanders were the Emir Ali Wad el Helu, the
Emir Khalid Zogal (commandant of Dongola), and Wad Zubehr
Rahama, the son of Zubehr, who escaped across the frontier last
autumn. Many hundred rifles, swords, spears, and shields still
litter the plain, where they are being collected; and in the
camp behind the hill were found no fewer than fifty-nine noggaras
or war drums.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The situation is inexplicable. The foe is at the gates. The
outposts have been driven in, and it said that two of the forts
have been surrendered. All day long a great stream of vehicles,
laden with every imaginable article of furniture, and accompanied
by crowds of disconsolate citizens, has been pouring into Paris
over every available bridge. The Bois de Boulogne is a huge
camp, and every tree along the Boulevards serves as shelter to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>suburban family. Yet the absence of excitement is extraordinary.
There has been a good deal of murmuring at the interference of
the Government with the Generals. Divided counsels, it is said,
and a refusal to give General de Saussier a free hand, led to the
defeats in Belgium. As usual, a mob assembled this morning in
front of the Tuileries, crying out for the deposition of the President;
and it is reported that a couple of Government clerks were
somewhat maltreated. But the demonstration was insignificant,
probably the work of German <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">provocateurs</span></i>, and the crowd of
roughs and pickpockets dispersed with the utmost rapidity when
two squadrons of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardes Républiques</span> were seen trotting down
the Boulevard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The execution of the seven Anarchist leaders three days ago
has had a very salutary effect. I have just had an interview with
M. de Freycinet’s private secretary. He has become positively
bland at the sound of the German cannon, distinctly heard beyond
the river. To my reflections on the gravity of the situation he
replied, with a smile and a bow, that although New York and
Philadelphia were once occupied by the enemy, yet the American
Revolution was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un fait accompli</span></i>. As we were speaking the President’s
carriage passed at a trot, and I had a good view of the
cool-headed citizen who holds the anxious position of First
Magistrate of the Republic. He certainly displayed no symptoms
of anxiety, and I fancy the crowd that witnessed his progress
found something magnetic in his easy smile. Never in the
piping times of peace have I heard such plaudits as followed his
equipage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same air of quiet confidence characterises all the members
of the Government whom I have met to-day. Whether it is
justified or not, only the future can reveal; but I may say that,
notwithstanding the defeat at Machault, the rapid advance of the
Germans on the capital, and the occupation of Rheims, the spirit
of the French nation is untamed. My military friends own
frankly that at Machault they were fairly beaten by superior
numbers. The movement into Belgium, they say, was intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>merely as a demonstration, and the commander exceeded his
orders in fighting a pitched battle against great odds. As to the
capture of Rheims, they preserve a discreet silence; and the
report of the annihilation of two divisions near Bar-le-Duc is
received with an incredulous smile. Even whilst admitting the
fact that many wounded men have been abandoned to the care
of the enemy, one of General de Saussier’s aides-de-camp shrugged
his shoulders, and remarked that they would be none the worse
for a short visit to the Rhine. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous verrons ce que nous verrons!</span></i></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The President’s smile seems to have had some reason. The
rescue of Paris has been accomplished in as dramatic a fashion
as that of Andromeda. General de Negrier is the Perseus. At
2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> the quiet of the summer night was suddenly broken.
Above the ceaseless rumble of the carts along the Boulevards were
heard the unmistakable sounds of battle, and the eastern horizon
was lit up as if by the northern lights. The weird streamers of
the electric lanterns in the forts struck quivering through the
darkness; and away beyond, the long rattle of musketry rose and
fell. Mounting in hot haste, I rode down to the Porte St. Mandé,
but could get no further. Very wisely, the road was kept clear
for the troops, should they be compelled to retreat, and in any
case the long train of ammunition tumbrils and ambulances left
but little room for enterprising civilians. The high parapet of the
old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enceinte</span></i> was thronged with anxious crowds, a black, silent
mass, gazing intently into the darkness out beyond. At one time
the roar of battle appeared to be coming nearer. It may have
been due perhaps to a change in the wind; but the suppressed
exclamations and the sudden impulsive movement showed the
pent-up excitement of the people. Then there was a lull; and
then the muffled roar was heard again, but distinctly further
away, and even as we listened, receding in the distance. It was
at this moment that a faint echo of trumpets and rolling drums
was borne upon the breeze, followed by the far-off sound of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>mighty cry, the long shout of triumph of a victorious onset; and
a deep sigh of relief burst from the close-packed thousands on the
wall. It was not till day had dawned that a staff-officer was seen
galloping towards the Porte St. Mandé from the battlefield; and
we learned that the garrison of Paris had inflicted a decisive
defeat on their over-confident foe, and that last year’s experiments
in offensive operations by night around the capital had borne
their full fruit. As I write, ambulance after ambulance full of
wounded, and long columns of German prisoners, dirty, footsore,
and begrimed with powder, attest the severity of the fighting and
the completeness of the victory.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have had the opportunity of speaking to some of the German
prisoners. One of them, a gentleman whom I have often met in
Washington and Boston, says the troops were exhausted by the
hard work of the previous days, and believing the French were
thoroughly cowed, were utterly disconcerted by De Negrier’s
sudden offensive. He blames the rashness of the leaders in pushing
on to Paris with large armies still in the field on either flank
of their communications. It appears that before the attack took
place news had been received of a great disaster to the covering
force of three Corps near Bar-le-Duc, and this was the Medusa’s
head which paralysed the German power of resistance. ‘Oh, for
one hour of Von Moltke,’ is the universal sentiment amongst the
prisoners. Another officer, a Bavarian, was much surprised at
the reports of great German successes in the East which have
appeared in the English newspapers. He declares that the French
movements were merely reconnaissances in force, in two instances
pushed too far, and that the Germans suffered very heavily. The
number of prisoners taken by the Germans has been very greatly
exaggerated; the majority were severely wounded men, and are
a great source of trouble to their captors. This officer appears
to have little love for the Emperor, scoffs at his ‘divine mission,’
and hints that Bavaria, at least, is very weary of the Prussian
hegemony.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Germans are in full retreat. The force that last night
threatened the capital from the west has been heavily defeated by
De Negrier. Paris is itself again. A member of the Government
tells me that General de Saussier, acting on De Miribel’s advice,
had resolved from the first to allow the rash offensive of the
enemy to have free play; believing that the traditions of 1870
and the terrible strain of a double war on their meagre resources
would impel them to make a rush on Paris, in the hope of finishing
the war at a single blow. The Emperor seems to have
expected much from internal dissensions in France. ‘But,’ says
the Minister, ‘when the aristocrats condescended to become
Republicans, France became once more a nation. In 1870 we had
our Federals and Confederates, our Imperialists and our Radicals.
To-day, political differences mean as little as in America.’</p>

<p class='c011'>At length the embargo placed on all letters since the 30th of
May has been removed, and the correspondents are free to telegraph
without restriction as to matter or quantity. Since May
the 25th, until ten days ago, General de Galliffet’s magnificent
army has been quiescent under shelter of the strong camps of
Langres, Epinal, and Belfort. Even our cavalry has had little to
do beyond sending out numerous officers’ patrols, north, east, and
west. The General preferred trusting to a strong screen of infantry
outposts; and on their side the Germans, though reported
to be very strong in the neighbourhood of Bar-le-Duc, have
remained inactive.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>It is surprising with what patience the French soldiery endured
this weary time of waiting; but the men have supreme
confidence in the hero of Sedan, and their intelligence is of a very
high order. However, your Frenchman is a restless being, and
discipline was put to a severe test when rumour of a German
advance on Paris filtered through the camps. But General de
Galliffet, by most judicious orders of the day, exposing the errors
of the Germans in advancing without first securing their communications,
and enlarging on the strength of the fortifications of
the capital, appealed to the soldierly intelligence of the army, and
not in vain. Still, the fierce desire of the troops to meet their
detested enemies had been curbed almost beyond bounds by the
20th of June, and I scarcely think, strong as the General is, that
he would have dared to delay movement for another day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long before day had broken on the 20th the march began;
and for nine days, over the magnificent roads which run through
the rich pastoral country west of the Moselle, the long columns
moved past in the blazing summer weather, their faces set northward,
and their hearts longing for the battle so long deferred.
The splendid marching powers of the French Infantry of to-day,
as well as the high-training and experience of the Staff, make the
movement of 200,000 men and more than 700 guns a matter of
child’s play. The marches are long, and the dust stifling; but
still order and regularity are the characteristics of the great
exodus from the fortresses. The ambulances are empty, and,
heavily weighted as they are, the little linesmen in their long
blue capotes and wide red trousers swing steadily along, laughing
and singing as the sun nears his setting even more cheerily than
when the fields on either hand were fresh with the morning dew.
Loud are the cheers that greeted the General, active as the
youngest subaltern of Hussars in spite of his sixty odd years, as
magnificently mounted, he rides slowly past the regiments, with
cheery word of greeting and encouragement to his sturdy <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fantassins</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning of yesterday reports came in from the cavalry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>riding more than twenty miles to the front, that the Prussians
were also advancing; and the same evening came the first presage
of the storm: two or three ambulances—full this time—and half-a-dozen
captured Uhlans. This sight stilled song and jest: a
grim silence fell upon the columns, and an air of fierce determination
took the place of the eager excitement which had hitherto
lit up those mobile faces. The bivouacs that night were very
quiet; the men gathered in little groups round the camp kettles,
or sat apart in their shirt-sleeves, assiduously cleaning their rifles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late last night, as I was turning into my humble billet, shared
by two officers of the Staff, in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Curé’s</span> cottage at Maison d’Or,
I received a message from the Major commanding a Chasseur
battalion, who had for the past three days been moving forward
with the cavalry, that he had obtained permission for me to
accompany him on the morrow. It was unlikely, so my
friends on the Staff informed me, that the armies would come
into collision, and if I joined <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les petites vitriers</span></i> I would have an
opportunity of seeing something of the cavalry fighting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before daybreak, therefore, I found myself in a tiny village
consisting of a church and half-a-dozen farm-houses, with substantial
granaries and gardens, and a single cabaret, in company
with one of those battalions <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’elité</span></i> of the army, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chasseurs à
pied</span></i>, who boast that the cavalry can neither leave them behind
nor do without them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The village stands in the centre of a rolling valley nearly
three miles broad, running east and west, with a long ridge to the
south and another to the north, dotted with vineyards and potato-patches;
but without hedge, or wall, or ditch.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the tower of the church, where I found a convenient loft
and a narrow window, I could see, through the morning mist,
little bodies of cavalry well to the front; and behind the village
three regiments of Dragoons were standing, dismounted beside
their horses. Away to the north one would hear at long intervals
a shot or two, and messengers came riding rapidly back to the
brigade in rear. One thing struck me as curious; although I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in the midst of the village, scarcely a Chasseur was to be seen;
and it was not for some time that I descried blue uniforms lying
behind the orchard walls, and now and then a <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">kepi</span></i> was to be seen
at the windows looking on to the single broad street.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>BRISK CAVALRY ENGAGEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As the sunbeams gained more power, I saw that the open
slopes of the opposite ridge, more than a mile and a half away,
were covered with little groups of horsemen, moving steadily forward,
and apparently pressing back our scouts. Even the isolated
squadrons to the front began to give back at a walk, when by the
corner of a wood on the sky-line, a sudden appearance of dark
groups of men and horses, with white electric-looking flashes,
betokened the advent of a battery. The explosion of the first
shells awakes our cavalry brigade to action. A couple of batteries
disengage themselves from the mass of horsemen in rear, and
from a knoll to the left of the village our guns are soon replying
to the enemy’s challenge. Shrilly the trumpets sound. The
dragoons mount, and with jingling scabbards and tossing plumes
trot away to where a deep fold in the ground affords them better
cover. This movement is not unobserved by the German scouts;
I can see them racing back over the hill, and in a few moments,
it seems, a dark mass of horsemen appears against the northern
horizon, the serried lances standing out clearly against the cloudless
sky. Again the shrill blast of the trumpet, and our eighteen
hundred dragoons are moving out to meet the foe. With a rush
and rattle the rear regiments take ground to either flank, and the
long sabres flash from their scabbards. The hussars are retiring
rapidly, away to the left of the guns, and the field is left clear for
the shock of the opposing masses. My blood tingles with excitement.
The sun glints bravely on the brass helmets of the Frenchmen;
the dark blue mass a mile away is gathering pace like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>mighty breaker of a stormy sea. The lances drop as if by magic,
the long line changes its direction, and then wheels inward. I
can see the officers turning in their saddles, far in front of their
squadrons, signalling with gleaming swords; a hundred seconds
will bring them together, when suddenly, to my horror and disappointment,
the French slacken speed, and, before I can realise
the fact, have turned rein and are riding past the village as if for
their lives. Squadrons to the right, squadrons to the left, and a
troop or so clattering madly down the ill-paved street. Far above
the crash of iron hoofs and the rush of flying squadrons I can hear
the hoarse cry of triumph of the foe. Down they come, heads
and lances low, racing in pursuit. A last salvo, which sends a
score of horses stumbling in their tracks, breaks for a moment the
symmetry of that magnificent line, and hurls an officer helpless
beneath the thundering hoofs, and our batteries have limbered up
and dash frantically, with gunners plying whip and spur, across
the plain.</p>

<p class='c011'>They are lost, they are lost, so fast follows the foe, riding in
furious haste to gather the trophies of the fight. A great cloud of
dust rises before them, but I can see the faces of the men as the
squadrons diverge to pass the village, and note the laughter and
the shouts of those fair-haired troopers with the scales upon their
shoulders. Suddenly the leader, riding like Scarlett at Balaclava,
twenty lengths in front, leans back in his stirrups, checks his
charger in his headlong career, and throws his hand high above
his head. The trumpeter beside him raises the trumpet to his
lips, but ere the notes ring out they are drowned in a loud roar of
musketry. I had forgotten the Chasseurs in the orchards; the
Germans had never suspected their presence. The surprise is
complete; the disaster overwhelming. Magazine after magazine
is unloaded, and thousands of bullets find an easy target in the
seething, struggling mass, just now advancing so magnificently in
all the pride of order and victory. Round the village the scene is
indescribable. The slaughter is terrible, and in a few moments
the squadrons that had passed unscathed on either side come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>flying back in the utmost disorder, pursued on one side by dragoons,
on the other by hussars. The valley is covered to right
and left with a dense crowd of horsemen, galloping in all the
excitement of the flight and the pursuit, whilst the German
batteries on the bridge pour shell after shell into the surging
crowd, regardless whether their mark is friend or foe. I have
little time to reflect on the skill with which the trap had been set
and baited. My friend the Commandant calls me from my eyrie,
and before I had time even to note the trace of the stirring events
I had seen passing before me, the Chasseurs are retreating from
the village at a pace which puts my Rosinante to the trot. Very
soon we hear the jingle of the cavalry in rear. The dragoons are
retiring also, and as I look back across the valley I can see the
long screen of scouts falling back slowly across the valley, so still
and peaceful but an hour agone, and now strewn with the awful
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</span></i> of the conflict. Such was the first phase of the battle of
the 29th of June. ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un apéritif</span></i>,’ remarks the Commandant.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE BATTLE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The curtain is not long in drawing up for the second act, and
on our side at least the actors are ready for their cue. From the
crest of the ridge which we have now reached a brilliant scene is
visible. A broad expanse of verdant pasture stretches away to
the placid river which runs between the willows, past the white
houses of the little town. Here and there is a patch of woodland,
a few stately poplars, and here and there a vineyard. The white
high road, with its leafy avenue of spreading trees, now turned
into telegraph poles, runs direct to the bridge. On either side, in
squares and oblongs, bright with blue and crimson, with flashing
bayonet and brazen helmet, rests an enormous army, and still the
never-ending columns of men and guns and waggons are forming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>up for battle for miles away on every side. On the ridge which
hides this huge array from the advancing enemy are three batteries,
filling the air with uproar, and attracting volley after volley of
Prussian shells. One can hear the shrill whizz of the shrapnel,
and turning again to the front, we see that on the slopes below us
the cavalry skirmishers, kneeling amongst the climbing vines, are
in action all along the line. The Chasseurs have scattered along
the crest, but there are no other infantry visible. I cannot believe
De Galliffet is napping. Above the town rises a great yellow
globe, swaying gracefully with every breath of air, and I know
that the General has a penchant for observing his enemy from the
vantage-point of the balloon. If he is really poised up there, in
the bright morning air, he must see those long sombre lines of
skirmishers moving slowly across the plain; those heavier masses
doubling rapidly over the opposite crest and moving down the
slopes. He must know that there are at least six batteries in
action against us, and that there are men bleeding to death beneath
the tendrils of the vines.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still not a sign. A couple of Staff officers stand near those
three poplars on the hill; one of our batteries falls back, leaving a
gun behind. The cavalry begin to creep further up the hill, but
not an infantryman moves. The enemy has halted more than
1200 yards away. They are lying in long rows athwart the valley,
and the incessant movement of the rifles, even more than the
deafening rattle, tell us that they are pouring in a heavy fusillade.
Another battery to the rear, and yet another; horses falling
wounded in the traces: and then, as if at a given signal, the long
German lines press forward. Their heaviest masses are away
over yonder on our left, where that thick wood, with scarped,
quarried slopes below, terminates the ridge whereon we stand;
and over to the right, where a marshy brook, its stunted willows
still shrouded in mist, breaks through the ridge to join the river,
we can see shadowy columns moving in the far distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another ten minutes, perhaps five, if the Chasseurs give way,
and the enemy will overlook the valley, the town, and the bridges—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>bridges, the most important of all. But even as apprehension
gathers it is dispelled. Turn your back for a moment and
look to the south. The earth is in motion. Long lines of guns
are dashing forward at a gallop, breasting the gentle slope, and
driving the dust behind them in swirling clouds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long lines of Infantry are already near the crest, and heavy
columns are rapidly moving up in rear. The unsuspecting Germans
are little more than a thousand paces distant when all along
the brow, bare and solitary just now, two hundred field-pieces
come into action almost at the same moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a moment more the air is literally shaken by the rush and
scream of a hurtling storm of heavy metal; and, lying down in
the intervals between the groups of guns, the infantry sweeps the
plain with volley after volley. The cavalry has retired behind
the hill; the vineyards are no longer tenanted, and the vine
leaves, cut by the sheet of bullets, fly in the air as if blown upwards
by the wind.</p>

<p>FRENCH CAVALRY CHARGING THE PRUSSIAN INFANTRY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>The Prussians stagger beneath the shock. Lines shake and
waver; here give back, and there lie still and motionless; columns,
though far away, break and dissolve under the shrapnel, and then
deploy in haste and confusion; and, above all, the bright sun
shines down without a wreath of smoke to sully his radiance, or
to hide his target from the rifleman. Vainly the supporting lines
of the Prussians are hurried to the front. Impotently the cavalry
ride forward. Their guns are already silenced. The squadrons
are checked by an inextricable tangle of falling men and horses.
The long line of infantry is no longer intact. Men are hastening
to the rear, not singly, but in groups. Officers stand out in front
for a moment, and then are seen no more save in shapeless huddled
forms on the dewy grass. The volleys of the French became more
regular and machine-like every moment. A mounted group
reaches the hill. It is the General, his Staff beside him, his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fanion</span></i> at his side. They are too far off to hear, but I can see
De Galliffet pointing to the front, and the infantry are already
moving forward, swooping down upon their prey. He must be an
enemy of more than mortal courage who, decimated and outnumbered,
can withstand the swift yet steady onset of these trim,
regular lines of blue and red. And look, behind—there, in the
interval! A long array of tossing heads and nodding plumes.
The Cuirassiers of France! Let the infantry shake them; brave
horsemen, your time is coming! ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N’oubliez pas Reichshoffen!</span></i>’
yells a wounded corporal by my side, and the mighty mass breaks
into a trot, and across the plain they dash, the horse artillery
racing in their wake, whilst <em>viva</em> after <em>viva</em> speeds their onset.
The German cavalry, what is left of it, comes gallantly forward to
meet their antagonists, and, if possible, to save their infantry.
But it is too late. In a few moments the plain is covered with a
broken crowd of soldiers. Groups rallying round their officers are
swept away by flying horsemen or serried squadrons; thousands
are now struggling for the ridge; in the centre the Cuirassiers are
bearing all before them in the frenzy of the charge, and on the
flanks the infantry, with rattling volleys, sweep away the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</span></i>
of the battle as leaves before the gale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the French reached the ridge beyond, long after the
cavalry had retired to re-form, it appears that they met fresh
masses of infantry hurrying forward to the assistance of their
comrades; but the impetus of victory was too great to be withstood.
The fresh troops became involved in the disaster of their
advanced guard, and long ere mid-day De Galliffet was in secure
possession of the second ridge, across which at daybreak I had
seen the Germans advance.</p>

<p class='c011'>About the noontide hour both armies seemed, as it were by
consent, to allow a breathing space. It was as if some invisible
Marshal of the Lists had thrown down his baton. So here, behind
the ridge, whilst the blazing sun passed over the meridian, lay the
columns of the French. Over against them, in the rolling and
open valley, but out of range, were the faint, blue, wavy lines
which marked their enemy’s position.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not till after two o’clock that I saw General de Galliffet—who
had been standing alone, looking intently towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>enemy and impatiently beating his foot upon the ground—make
a gesture of relief, and turning sharp to his orderly dragoon bid
him bring up his horse. At the same moment the German infantry
began to move. The artillery had been for some time in action.
A perfect hail of shells tore up the level surface of the ridge, and
our batteries were one by one retiring. Our present line of
infantry is several hundred yards behind the hill, down in the
valley, cooking their soup undisturbed by the shrapnel, and only
a few are called up now to assist the guns against hostile skirmishers.
On come the Prussians, but it is soon evident that the
main attack is not against our centre. Away to the left there,
where General Jamont, the trusted Commander of the 5th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Corps
d’Armée</span>, holds watch and ward, the sky is red with dust, and the
thunder of the guns and the rattle of musketry is threefold heavier
than with us. I can see our troops moving in the valley below,
from centre to left, linesmen and guns, hurrying to the point of
contact. I am on the point of riding in the same direction, when
one of M. de Galliffet’s aides-de-camp suggests that I have already
a place in the stalls. ‘Down below,’ he says, pointing to the
valley, ‘will be played the last agony of Prussia.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The suspense is terrible. The volleys rise and fall, the roar of
the cannon swells and dies way. The minutes drag by on leaden
wings. The troops in our front are not advancing, even the
Artillery seems lazy this afternoon, and there, even there, where
the red dust-clouds hang over a hell of slaughter, the fate of a
nation is being decided. It is in vain I endeavour to imitate the
imperturbability of the General, our ‘lance of iron,’ as the soldiers
have learned to call him. A messenger or two rides up, and is
dismissed. There is not a sign on that impassive countenance.
Here is another, galloping at speed, grey with dust, and horse
foaming with haste. At last! The General straightens himself
up. He raises his hand to his <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">kepi</span></i> with the golden leaves, as if
he were saluting a superior. Is it France or Fortune!</p>

<p class='c011'>The Staff, throwing away their cigarettes, are all animation
now. Officers and orderlies gallop recklessly down the hill at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>break-neck speed. There is a stir amongst those sleeping columns
below. Men spring to their arms. I can hear the harsh words of
command, and note the tricolours with their golden fringes given to
the breeze. The long lines ascend the hill. What has happened?
The enemy in front is moving to the attack: we shall hold the
second ridge as we held the first. But no, it is more than this.
This time, as our guns come into action all along the crest, our
infantry do not halt beside them. There is no pause now.
Straight down the slopes they go, the shells screaming overhead,
and the little groups of tirailleurs halting alternately to deliver
their biting volleys. Here, sheltered by a friendly poplar, I can
look down upon the scene. ‘What worthy enemies!’ cries a little
surgeon who has joined me. ‘What a struggle of heroes!’ And
so it was—while life lasts I shall never forget De Galliffet’s charge.
Sixty thousand men, line after line, were hurled against the
German centre. And how bravely those Germans fought! And
now, looking back in cold blood, how needlessly were they
butchered! Exactly opposite where I stood, their infantry moved
forward with even more than the precision of a parade; in little
squads, but shoulder to shoulder, with all the rigidity of a birthday
review. I could even see the officers halting and actually
correcting the alignment. Needless to say, these living targets
were riddled through and through in the very moment of their
pedantic folly. In the rear, too, came lines of men, gallantly
moving forward to beat of drum, with that extraordinary, high-stepping
pace which excites the ridicule of the Transatlantic
visitor in Berlin. How the veterans of our Civil War would have
scoffed at this slave-driver’s discipline! But even the veterans of
the Wilderness and Gettysburg would have admired the bravery
of those devoted Teutons. At 400 yards from each other the two
lines came to a standstill. Very irregular is the front; here the
French are giving back, and here the German officers are driving
up their stragglers; all are standing, there is no cover on that
open plain; the French volleys have dissolved into fierce individual
fire, and the masses sway backwards and forwards in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>infernal din. Of a sudden, behind me, sounds the blare of trumpets
and the roll of many a score of drums. De Galliffet’s reserve is
coming up to decide the conflict, and as the serried lines crowned
the ridge, the Germans, battling fiercely in the valley below, began
to break. And then, whilst the setting sun, pouring his red rays
athwart the opposing hosts and striking radiance from the golden
eagles of the tricolours, sank slowly on that awful Aceldama, the
French army moved onward to its triumph. Wild and exulting
were the shouts that rent the air; far above the roar of battle and
the clang of drum and trumpet pealed the maddening cry for
vengeance, and like a tornado—with irresistible strength and
order—the young soldiers of the Republic swept down to obliterate
the sorrow and the shame of 1870. Not for a moment was the
issue in doubt. With all the hereditary courage of their caste, the
German officers died in their tracks, disdaining to give back a
single foot; but the Cuirassiers were once more let loose, the
General himself directing their onslaught, and before darkness
fell not a single sound man in the German army but was far
upon the road to Metz. Our victory is complete; as I write, the
cavalry is still pushing the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since the great battles took place which ended in the falling
back of the Russian forces, events have followed in that region
which have been of the utmost importance, though the mere
details from day to day have not been of sufficient interest to
chronicle. The Russian army in the field, unable after its severe
losses to oppose the far out-numbering forces of its enemies, has
adopted its traditional policy. It has retreated into the interior
of the country, leaving large garrisons in Warsaw and Ivangorod.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Germany has undertaken the siege of Warsaw, Austria that of
Ivangorod. The German and Austrian cavalry, which have now
asserted their absolute superiority over the Cossacks, have followed
up the retreating Russians far enough to completely separate the
Russian forces to the south of the great marsh region which
stretches out behind the great fortress of Brest-Litewsk from those
in the north. A German army is laying siege to Brest-Litewsk.
The single line of railway which connects that fortress across the
marsh has been utterly destroyed for an immense distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the two Governments, now in complete command of
the open country, have taken a political step which cannot but be
received with satisfaction by the civilised world. They have issued
a proclamation declaring their intention to erect Poland into a buffer
State against the aggressions of Russia, and have pledged themselves
not to conclude peace without guaranteeing its independence.
The exact borders of the restored kingdom have not been fixed,
but it is apparently intended to include Lithuania, and to stretch
up to the borders of the marshes.</p>

<p class='c011'>One important fortress has already fallen. The Germans, taking
advantage of the facilities which the rivers and the railways
afforded them, have brought up heavy siege artillery, with which
they have bombarded the defences of Novo Giorgiewsk. The effect
of the cordite shells on parts of the fortifications which had not
been adequately prepared to resist them, is described as amazing.
These terrible instruments of destruction, now first used in war, are
said to have simply swept away the solid defences of the place.
The garrison was helpless, and after a most gallant but hopeless
resistance surrendered.</p>

<p class='c011'>It appears to be only a question of time, and not a long time,
before the same process is applied to Warsaw. Indeed, the confidence
of the Germans in this respect has put an end to what
threatened to be an appalling tragedy. On leaving General
Hashkoff in command at Warsaw, General Gourko had ordered
him to expel the whole civil population of the town. This
measure was adopted, not merely because of the notorious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>sympathies of the inhabitants with the invaders, but because
Warsaw has been crowded with such immense numbers of disabled
soldiers, and the place had been filled to such an extent by
fugitives at the time when it was invested, that it was feared that
provisions, on which a large demand had been necessarily made
for the army in the field, would not last long. It was a terrible
temptation to the Germans to repeat the method of the siege of
Metz of 1870, and to throw on the Russians the responsibility for
allowing the expelled inhabitants to starve.</p>

<p class='c011'>Happily, other considerations prevailed. The rapid success at
Novo Giorgiewsk, the complete knowledge that the Germans had
of the nature of the defences with which they had to deal, the
great importance of conciliating the Poles and enlisting them heart
and soul in the cause, all contributed to induce the German
authorities to receive the fugitives.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there were forty-eight hours of suspense during which the
sufferings of the inhabitants outside the walls, while not yet
admitted into the German camp, were terrible, and their agonising
fears still worse. The matter had to be referred to the Emperor,
now in France. A personal appeal to his humanity by Her
Majesty the Queen, most delicately and cautiously worded, but
indirectly suggesting how difficult it would be to keep together
the great Alliance if anything occurred that outraged the public
conscience of Europe and America—and to do him justice, the
real humanity of the Emperor himself—finally decided the
question.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wretched inhabitants were not only received, but carefully
looked after, and at once dispatched to places safe from the clash
of arms. Meantime, enormous numbers of Poles have been
enrolled and equipped. Numbers of both officers and men trained
in the Russian Army who have surrendered, or made good their
escape, together with Polish officers from the Austrian and
Prussian Armies serve as an admirable nucleus for enrolment, so
that by the time the Russians are ready to attempt any advance
against their victorious enemies, a new element of considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>importance will be added to these. A most valuable part of the
contingent of trained Polish officers and soldiers was provided by
the army which surrendered in Bulgaria. Russia has always pursued
the policy of sending her Polish soldiers as far from their homes
as possible; the army invading Bulgaria was, therefore, largely
made up of these. They have gladly transferred their services on
hearing of the coming regeneration of their ancient kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime, it appears that Russia sees that she has no prospects,
for some time to come, of being able to act offensively against the
Allied Powers, and that they do not intend to favour her by
plunging into Inner-Russia. Stores and transports must be collected
in large quantities before the Russians can again advance,
and the impoverished condition of the country makes this a very
difficult task. As, however, she does not wish to keep her soldiers
idle, and is most anxious to score a success somewhere before she
asks for peace, which every day is becoming more inevitable for
her, she has largely reinforced her army in Asia Minor, which has
hitherto been kept inactive by her tremendous necessities in other
directions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moukhtar Pasha has been falling back slowly and cautiously,
as he found the forces increasing in his front. Several English
officers are with his army. They speak highly of the efficiency
which it has attained, and indignantly deny that any cruelties
have been perpetrated by the regular Turkish soldiery, though
they speak of the Kurds and Bashi-Bazouks as brutes, whom it
is most difficult to keep in any kind of order—men who are as
cowardly as they are brutal, and of whom the army would be
well rid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the movements of the English Army a dead silence has
fallen. All letters whatever, whether of correspondents or others,
since the fleet sailed after the Battle of Kosluji, have been stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have heard, indeed, of some of the fleet, probably cruisers,
being off Odessa, and some alarm was recently created at Kertch
by what was taken to be a combined expedition against that point.
We have, however, as yet heard of no landing. This cannot last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>for long. We must get some news shortly. We know that
immense numbers of vessels with stores, transport, and tools of all
sorts have passed Constantinople with sealed orders to be opened
only out of sight of land. Ministers are studiously reticent, and
appeal to the patriotism of both Houses not to put inconvenient
questions. Breathless excitement attends the next move.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime, in France the situation remains nearly as our correspondent
left it. The German armies, after their recent disasters,
have been falling back and concentrating in the Vosges between the
fortresses of Metz and Strasbourg. The French appear to be massing
their forces chiefly in the neighbourhood of Belfort, though a large
army has approached Metz, which is held by too powerful an army
to be ignored. The French are in a state of great exultation and
excitement, but considerable disenchantment has taken place as
to the Russian alliance. They think that Russia has by no means
proved the powerful ally they had expected. It is even no longer
treason to say upon the Boulevards that sympathy with Poland
was the ancient policy of France. Till the extent of their recent
successes began to be popularly realised, it was even suggested
that if the Germans would give up Alsace-Lorraine they might have
their buffer State against Russian barbarism. Nay, some were not
afraid to suggest that Germany might, if she would, create two
buffer States on either frontier, a covert hint at the neutralisation
of the Reichsland which a few weeks ago was received with
silent assent. There can be no doubt also that the German people
are becoming very weary of a war which threatens to be of indefinite
length on either frontier. The Emperor, too, despite the
successes on the Russian side which were not gained under his
immediate command, has been not a little disillusioned as to the
absolute infallibility of his own military genius.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian forces have been checked by the news of the
French successes, and the fear lest the vast forces now available
might be turned against them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus everywhere on the Continent it is a moment of temporary
lull, though of active preparation for the future.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CAPTURE OF SIERRA LEONE BY THE FRENCH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The letter which we publish from our Correspondent who
accompanied the troops to India, must be preceded by a few words
of explanation as to the circumstances which induced the Government
to send a large party of officers and a small reinforcement
of men by the Canadian Pacific route. That route for Calcutta is
a little longer in point of time than the movement by the Cape.
It was recognised from the first that in time of war it would not
be desirable to depend upon the Suez Canal route, but it had been
fully intended to employ the Cape line. Unfortunately, however,
immediately after war was declared by France against us, communication
with Sierra Leone was in some way cut. Some time
passed before we heard what had happened. Then it appeared
that, prior to the declaration of war, the French Governor of
Senegal had been warned of the date at which it was intended in
France to declare war, and was directed to dispatch from Goree a
powerful expedition as quietly and secretly as possible. This,
taking advantage of the concentration of the English fleets in the
Baltic and Mediterranean, was to sail from Goree with sealed
orders to be opened at sea, which directed the commanding
Admiral, on a date named, to move straight upon Sierra Leone,
and to attack it on the day that the declaration of war was issued
in Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>It should be noticed, as a question of method and of the
facilities presented by steam for such operations, that no great
gathering of ships was allowed to attract attention to the preparations
in Senegal, and ship after ship arrived, received its equipment,
and departed alone, with orders to rendezvous on a given day at
a stated point in mid-ocean, fixed by latitude and longitude. In
this way, without attracting attention, and without difficulty, the
great fleet was collected, and moved off at the time named under
the orders of the Admiral and General upon Sierra Leone.</p>

<p class='c011'>The garrison of Sierra Leone has always been kept at a low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>ebb, because of the unhealthiness of the place. It was to have
been reinforced in view of war, but this had been postponed. The
movement was a complete surprise, and though indignant remonstrances
appeared in all the English papers, and in the letter
addressed by the Governor of Sierra Leone to the French Commander-in-Chief,
the fact remained that Sierra Leone had, for the
time being, passed into the hands of the French. Although statements
were freely made that such an outrage had never been
committed since the beginning of the world, and most English
people believed them, there was no difficulty in showing that
precedents from the actions of all countries were in favour of the
French. However, apart from the merits of that question, the
plain fact of the matter was that, with Sierra Leone in the hands
of the French, our whole route <em>viâ</em> the Cape to India was seriously
disturbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The French Fleet in Sierra Leone Harbour and based upon it,
threatened the whole line between St. Vincent and Ascension,
and deprived us of the fortified coaling station which was essential
for the supply of steamers along that route. Though no doubt,
in the long-run, Sierra Leone must fall to the Power which ultimately
secures the command at sea, we could not afford, for some
time, to fit out an expedition to retake it. The Government,
therefore, wisely decided, after its capture, to employ the Canadian
Pacific route for the purposes of communication with India and
the East. To Hong-Kong it was already our shortest route. In
any case, it was an absolutely safe one. The one great defect in
this mode of communication consists in the fact that no first-class
steamers at present ply across to Quebec. This, however, was
remedied by the Government chartering for the time one of the
best Atlantic liners, which easily transported the whole of the
force, consisting of about 200 officers and 1000 men, chiefly non-commissioned
officers, who were to be sent off to Calcutta.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SIEGE OF HERAT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Events in India had not developed with any great rapidity—in
fact, all those who have studied the question were fully
aware that, rapid as has been the approach of Russia towards
India, the two Powers are as yet too far distant to be able to
come into collision in a single campaign. The first indication of
Russian intrigue which reached us was the announcement that the
Ameer had been suddenly murdered, and that general anarchy
had ensued in Afghanistan. The enormous efforts which Russia
is making in other directions appear to have prevented her, so far
as we at present know, from attempting several of the routes by
which she might cross the mountains into Afghanistan. But an
advance was immediately made upon Herat, and the siege of that
fortress has been going on for some time. Fortunately two young
English officers, Major Craygrove, and Captain Greekill, had been
employed on some duty for the Government in the neighbourhood.
They immediately threw themselves into Herat, and,
inspiring the garrison with the greatest confidence, have been the
life and soul of the defence ever since. We hear the most
amusing accounts of the mode in which they diversify the rigour
of their defence by starting races of all kinds within the place,
and by various other forms of sport. On the whole, the Russians
seem as yet to have made very little way. The only danger has
been lest the English public, excited by the vigour of the defence,
should insist upon an expedition being dispatched to Herat. For
that we are by no means in a condition as yet. The movement
would be a most hazardous one. A force of observation has been
assembled at Quetta, and the whole Indian Army is ready to
advance at a moment’s notice. But it was clearly unadvisable to
throw ourselves into the seething cauldron of Afghanistan whilst
the tribes were all fighting with one another, and no possible
ruler had appeared on whose behalf we could effectually act.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was under these circumstances that the expedition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Vladivostock was decided upon, and that the reinforcement of
native troops was dispatched to Egypt. It would have been
preposterous to make these detachments from the army in
India had it not very soon become clear that for the first year of
the war, at all events, our position in India must be that of playing
a waiting game. We have assured Russia that we shall on
no terms make peace as long as she holds a foot of Afghan
territory. In view of her failure in Europe, and of the services
which we have been able to render to the Central Powers, the
zeal of the Russians in the invasion of Afghanistan appears to
have materially cooled. They begin to see that whatever successes
they may achieve during the course of the campaign, they are
likely to have to surrender their conquests at the end of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, as the demands of India for reinforcements of
officers and non-commissioned officers to fill up the various posts
which become necessary when an army is organised for war are
very considerable, it has been a great advantage to us to be able
to send out these men by the new line. Moreover, it is to a
certain extent an experiment which shows how much larger forces
could be sent in the event of necessity.</p>

<p>OUR NEW ROUTE TO INDIA: A SLEEPING-CAR ON THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This magnificent steamer has provided us with the most
luxurious accommodation, and has landed us here in less than six
days since we left England. I am just remaining on board to
finish this dispatch to you, and beyond expressing the satisfaction
of all on board with the treatment we have received from officers
and men, and with the arrangements of the company, I have only
one remark of any importance to make. All who have known
the inconveniences and delay which have hitherto attended the
voyage to Canada agree that it is a disgrace to the Empire that
no steamers of the class of the <em>Teutonic</em> are available to complete
the circle of our connection round the world. I have just been
on shore and seen the accommodation which is provided for us
by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Nothing can be more perfect
than the arrangements for the convenience both of officers and
men. If only passengers could start from England and sail here
through the splendid scenery of the St. Lawrence up to this
quaint old town, and thence pass by this excellent railway, there
can be no doubt that travellers, to the East at all events, whether
for China, Australia, New Zealand, or even India, would come
this way rather than by New York, or any other line. As it is,
numbers now cross to New York, join the Canadian Pacific by
way of Montreal, and complete their journey in that way to the
East. I can only hope, and I express the wishes of all, that no
time may be lost in establishing, with the aid of a Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>subsidy, a really effective line of steamers from England to
Quebec. Here the trains were drawn up by the side of the
steamer. The men marched straight into the carriages, the
baggage, for the transhipment of which large gangs of men were
at hand, was put upon the trains within five hours and fourteen
minutes. Precisely at that interval after the steamer had come
alongside, the first of the three trains employed steamed out of
the station amid the cheers of the crowd which had gathered to

<p class='c011'>It must be remembered that when the party of Marines and
Blue-Jackets, who were the pioneers of this line among the
military forces, came here in December, they necessarily landed
in Halifax. We have, therefore, saved on that expedition three
hundred miles of dreary railway travel by the Intercolonial
Railway.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have finished our journey across the continent, and are
all as thoroughly content with our railway trip as with our
voyage to Quebec. I enclose you several sketches which will
show you the accommodation provided for the men, and some of
the scenes on the train. What has interested us most, both in
what we have seen and what we have heard at the different
stations that we have stopped at, is the amazing development
which is taking place throughout the whole of this country.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old Ontario farmers appear to be all on the move farther
westwards. Splendid as is that province they appear to prefer
to sell off the farms they have made at the best rate they can, and
to move on to the rich new lands which are available in the north-west.
One hears of men here, who, with their own hands, having
three horses with all sorts of improved machinery, but no other
assistance, have actually sown a hundred acres of wheat this
spring. It is said here that in a very few years this region will
be able to supply a surplus grain crop for England equal to the
surplus product of the whole of the United States.</p>

<p>TOMMY ATKINS BARGAINING WITH THE INDIANS ON THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We were naturally a good deal interested in making inquiries
about the prospects of the great railway itself, which has done so
much for Canada and become such an important link between
different parts of the Empire. I came over it with the Governor-General’s
party which went down to British Columbia, soon after
the railway was opened. The development of the country itself,
of course, is the first thing that strikes me. Green fields of corn
and comfortable homesteads as far as the eye can reach, where
there was nothing but wild prairie! The trains loaded up with
corn of last year’s crop are still travelling eastwards to Quebec,
because it has not been even yet possible to transport it all, so
great is the accumulation. But no less remarkable were the
trains travelling westwards which we passed at the several
stations in our rapid transit, full of farmers, commercial travellers,
and others engaged in the rapidly developing commerce of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>country. Great piles of agricultural implements and household
stuff going westward showed that even in those parts of the line
where the land near the railway has been bought up by speculators,
so that cultivation recedes to some distance from it, rapid
development is taking place.</p>

<p>OUR NEW ROUTE TO INDIA: RATIONS ON THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The next thing that struck me was the immense improvement
that has been steadily effected in the permanent way of the line.
Steel bridges substituted for temporary wooden structures, embankments
that have taken the place of mere tressels, are visible
all along the route; and one sees the work steadily going on.
Then gradients have everywhere been eased and curves lessened,
so that the traffic facilities have marvellously improved. Of
course the improvement is most marked over that part of the
line where traffic is heaviest. The great stretch between Ottawa
and Port Arthur is now in most excellent condition. The work
proceeds steadily westward as the traffic necessities call for it.
We are now just about to embark on the <em>Empress of China</em>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Government had insisted upon two of the Empress steamers
being detained at Victoria for fear accommodation should not be
sufficient. But, with the adaptations made by the company, the
<em>Empress of China</em> alone proved ample, and as it was much more
convenient to have the whole party together, we are all embarking
on her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Great War has come to an end. The preliminaries of
peace have been signed. We have, therefore, now only to record
the events in different parts of the world which have brought this
about. In the first place, during that lull in the conflict on the
Continent which we recorded in our last reports, for many weeks
an almost complete silence fell over the centre of Europe. Commercial
relations, in their modern sense, were almost entirely
suspended.</p>

<p class='c011'>The German Government, recognising the impossibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>cutting off the sources of news as long as the telegraphs were
used at all, had, for a great emergency, paralysed all the communications
of Europe by stopping all telegraphic messages
along a broad belt extending from the Vistula to the Rhine, and
somewhat beyond those limits. No one knew what was going on;
till suddenly the French forces advancing into Alsace-Lorraine
became aware that the German Armies in their front had almost
doubled their strength.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian Army, warned of the great reinforcement which
had taken place, began to show a formidable and renewed activity.
The English Fleet, completely superior at sea since the victory of
Sardinia, vigorously enforced the blockades of the French Ports.
The Belgian Government now maintained a rigid line of observation
along the whole of its frontier. Similarly Spain exercised a
vigilant guardianship over all communications through the Pyrenees.
France, isolated, suffering greatly from the enormous disturbance
caused by the war, and finding her Generals unable to
pursue the successes which had appeared for a moment to attend
her arms, was becoming restless and discontented. The statesmen
at the head of affairs, by no means anxious to see a successful
soldier emerge from the war as their master, far from interfering
with the growth of the popular impression that any further
success was exceedingly problematical, encouraged it secretly in
every way. The Prefects, in fact, had orders to allow no news to
circulate which did not tend to discourage further action. Reports
of the overwhelming strength with which the Germans had inundated
the Reichsland, of the consequent danger of the force at Belfort,
were accompanied by suggestions that France had been betrayed
by Russia; that the great gathering of German troops against France
could not have taken place if Russia had acted with proper vigour
on the opposite frontier. It was thrown out, at first covertly,
afterwards more and more openly, that the moment was not opportune
for France to engage Europe single-handed; that the consequences
of any serious disaster might be fatal to France, and that
it would be better to be content with the laurels which had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>been gained, and which had restored the honour of the French
arms. Strasbourg, Metz, and the great fortresses in rear of them,
were represented as likely to prove dangerous obstacles to the
advance of the French Army. As the Generals were obliged to
delay action, this feeling grew, till France on her part was quite
in a humour to make peace if it could be concluded on reasonable
terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The longing for peace in Germany had also become intense.
The great increase of the force against France had been secured
only by the transfer by rail across Europe of the greater part of the
army that had been employed against Russia. For the moment
this was a perfectly safe operation; the Russian Army was in no
condition to act effectively, and the Austrian Army—with the
support of the newly-raised Polish troops, the Roumanian Army,
and the Bulgarians, who, having disposed at length of the troubles
in Macedonia, were ready to lend effective aid to their allies—was
fully competent at least to keep the Russians in check, if and
whenever it should again attempt to advance. Nevertheless the
consciousness in Germany that virtually her whole forces were
engaged against France, and that there was little to spare to resist
any movement that might be made by the Russians, kept up a
continual feeling of anxiety. There appeared to be every prospect
that Russia might be seriously crippled, and prevented from again
disturbing the peace of Europe, if peace could now be speedily
made. All these considerations were for many months telling
upon the two chief opponents in the struggle, during a time when
no very exciting events were taking place.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>ADJUSTMENT IN THE EAST.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In Asia Minor during the same period decisive events had
occurred. After all the preparations at Trebizonde and in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>neighbourhood were not so purely imaginary as the descent of the
English Army on Bulgaria had led us all to suppose. It appears
that ever since the beginning of the War a vast number of
labourers, under the direction of English engineer officers, had
been employed in improving the communications between the
neighbourhood of Erzeroum and Trebizonde. Under the protection
of Moukhtar Pasha’s Army, these preparations had gone on
from Erzeroum even during the time when the Black Sea was
temporarily abandoned by the English Fleet. As soon as it
was possible to do so, landing-stages had been multiplied, and
other steps taken to improve the facilities for disembarking at
Trebizonde. By the time that the English Army had finished its
little campaign in Bulgaria, all these improvements were so far
advanced that a light railway had been constructed almost
throughout the whole distance, giving the greatest possible facilities
for the accumulation of supplies. Huts had been built, and a
series of stations arranged for the advance of the English Army in
successive bodies as soon as it landed. The landing itself, however,
even with all the improvements made, could not be a very
rapid operation. Thus it was that, as soon as the surrender of
the Russian Army was secured, the portion of the English Army
nearest to the coast, and such troops as had arrived from England
too late to join in the campaign, were at once dispatched
direct to Trebizonde. These were followed by others in regular
succession.</p>

<p class='c011'>The actual disembarkation at Trebizonde occupied about a
fortnight, being interrupted for about four days by a very
dangerous gale, which obliged the troopers to put to sea. During
all that time, however, the movement inland proceeded rapidly,
thanks to the arrangements which had been previously made. The
English Army advanced by rapid stages towards the neighbourhood
of Erzeroum, into a position where it was able to concentrate
within half a day’s march of the left flank of the position, towards
which, in a short time, the Turkish Army slowly and deliberately
fell back. The front of the English Army was at right angles to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that of the Turkish, and withdrawn from it some four miles, but
there was ample telegraphic communication between the two
forces. A few Turkish scouts under English officers covered the
front of the English. The Russians, in advancing, drove in such
of these scouts as they saw. These retired as if upon the Turks.
Others, withdrawn behind the features of the ground, were not
observed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Russians made a mistake not very different from, but
much more fatal than, that which they committed in 1877, when
they advanced against Moukhtar Pasha, ignoring the force that
was threatening the communications of their left wing. In that
case Moukhtar had designedly fallen back in order to facilitate
the operations against them of the Van force. In the present
instance he similarly retired in order to facilitate the aggressive
movement of the English Army, of whose presence within the
region of operations they were as little aware as they had been
in 1877 of the approaching arrival of the Van force. They
had much more excuse in the present instance for not knowing
of the existence of the English column, both because all its
previous doings had been completely concealed from them, while
the movements of the Van force in 1877 were known in every
intelligence department in Europe, and also because the English
Army had only recently and very rapidly arrived at the prepared
rendezvous. The Russian Army, therefore, finding Moukhtar
Pasha in a position apparently open to attack, and presenting
facilities especially for the turning of his left flank, towards which
all his dispositions tempted them, committed themselves boldly to
a movement in that direction, employing a very large portion of
their force in an extended movement round his left. According
to an agreement between the Turkish Commander and the English
General, the Russian Army was allowed to involve itself for
nearly two hours in an apparently very successful attack upon the
centre and left of the Turkish position.</p>

<p class='c011'>All its movements had been well reported, by help of the
dirigible balloon which had been captured from the Russians in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Varna. Lord Wolseley was therefore able to determine with
some accuracy the right moment for making an attack with his
entire strength, first upon the flank and rear of the right wing
of the Russians; and when the latter, completely surprised and
attacked on all sides, because of the simultaneous advance of the
Turks, were broken and thrown into hopeless disorder, he was
able by simply advancing his front to drive the fugitives in
upon the hitherto untouched centre, which in its turn, assailed in
flank by the English Army, and in front by the left wing and
centre of the Turkish, was crushed. Thus the left wing was left a
helpless prey to the armies which now triumphantly occupied the
field.</p>

<p class='c011'>The English Government, made anxious by the protests which
had been directed against a campaign in Asia Minor or the
Caucasus, had ordered Lord Wolseley not to remain more than a
month on shore unless in the very heat of operations at the time.
As the crushing defeat of the Russian Army had left Moukhtar
Pasha in absolute command of the whole field of operations as far
as Kars, and as it was exceedingly unlikely that, after such a
defeat, the Russians would be able, in their exhausted condition,
to place another army in the field against him, the Turkish
General was well content to carry on the war for himself. The
English troops, therefore, were simply placed in healthy quarters
until instructions for their future disposition should be received.
The immediate object with which England had engaged in the
war having been secured by the relief of Bulgaria and the defeat
of the Russians in Asia Minor, it was decided to recall the army
home. It was considered that a victorious force, easily made
up again to 70,000 strong by home reinforcements, might become
an important element in assisting the Belgians to bring that
additional pressure upon France which might be necessary in
order to ensure the acceptance of satisfactory terms of peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>This further blow in Asia Minor, and the exhausted condition
of his country, induced the Czar to make the preliminary proposals
for a general peace. It was very soon found, however, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>practically Russia was isolated—France was thoroughly disenchanted
with the alliance. Russia had attempted too much and
too many things at first, and had consequently suffered everywhere.
It was evident that, if on the merits of the question either
of the two allies was to suffer, it was Russia who would have to
pay the piper. The Austrian and German Governments were too
deeply pledged to the Poles, and had too much interest in being
secure from Russian aggression, not to insist definitely upon the
creation of Poland into a buffer State. Though Russia demurred
to these terms as long as she could, the unanimity of the allies in
insisting upon them, and the secret sympathy with Poland of a
large proportion of the French people, obliged her to give way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SERVICES OF ENGLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>England insisted as a preliminary to all discussion of peace
proposals that the Russians should vacate absolutely all the territory
of Afghanistan, and retire to the previously deliminated
frontier. The services which England had rendered to the Alliance,
even as they appear on the surface of the story, were sufficiently
considerable. The original purpose of Russia had been to attack
Bulgaria. Thanks to the facility with which her fleet had cut the
communications of the Russian Army that landed there, and had
limited the force which Russia was able to employ, it had fallen to
the lot of the English to do what no other army could have done
with equal facility, that is, render the necessary assistance to the
Bulgarians, occupied as they had been by the Macedonian troubles.
The facilities for striking right and left presented by the command
of the sea has enabled her to deliver the second deadly
blow in combination with the Turkish army in Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, apart from the enormous general value which England’s
command of the sea conferred upon the Central Alliance, these
were by no means the only or the most important services which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>England had directly rendered towards strengthening the land forces
of the Continental powers. Up to the time of the battle of Sardinia
it would have been impossible for the Italian army to advance
against France at all. Her whole coast line, without the defence
of the English fleet, would have been at the mercy, not only of the
French Fleet, but of an expeditionary force of the French Army;
and the Italian Army, in order to be able to meet such an attack
wherever it might be made, must be all kept at home. Now, at
the critical moment, when Germany was hurrying up every man
that she could to the frontier to check the advance of the victorious
French, it was precisely the fact that the whole Italian Army
was available to join her in moving against France, which created
that excess of force that France was not able to resist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, it gradually came to be known that, without being
aware of it at the time, the English Fleet in the Baltic had conferred
another all-important service upon Germany on land as much as
at sea. It appeared that the object with which the French and
Russian fleets were endeavouring to clear the Baltic of all German
men-of-war was twofold. In the first place, if they had succeeded,
the Russian Fleet was intended to co-operate with the Russian
Army advancing from Kovno in an attack upon the German defences
on the Baltic—Memel, Königsberg, and Dantzig. But this
was not all. There was a considerable Russian force available at
the beginning of the war for which it was impossible to provide
transport and supplies towards the German frontier. This had
been gathered along the Baltic ports of Russia, with a view to its
being transported into Denmark. The Danish Army had been
gathered along the fortified frontier of the kingdom, Denmark
having declared herself neutral in the struggle. As soon as the
Russian force had landed and advanced towards the frontier, the
Danish Army would have joined the Russian. At an opportune
moment a declaration would have been issued simultaneously by
France and Russia, setting forth the wrongs which Germany had
inflicted upon Denmark, and declaring that Russia and France
were resolved to see justice done her. A French expeditionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>force formed of troops which could not, in the blocked condition or
the railways (already filled with ample numbers of troops and
stores), be transported from west to east of France, had gathered
in the western ports. This was to be transported as rapidly as
possible to reinforce the Russo-Danish Army. Thus, a large army
would have been collected within the frontiers of Denmark, where
it would be completely in rear of the general line of German defence
along the frontier. It might even threaten, at a time when
the German forces were pushed out east and west, to move upon
the unguarded capital of Berlin; or at least to break up and
destroy railways and telegraphs essential to the forces gathered on
the French frontier. All these dangers had been removed by the
action of the English Fleet, which, when joining the German in
the Baltic, had given command to the Central Allies of the sea
communications.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under these circumstances it was not difficult for the English
Government to insist that, as a preliminary to all discussion of
peace negotiations, every Russian soldier should evacuate the territories
of Afghanistan. If the Indian bazaars had been fluttered
by the temporary advance of the Russian Army to Herat, the compensation
was ample. The ignominious withdrawal of the Russian
Army was not the less effective because it was in exact accordance
with the proclamation which had been made at home and in India,
at the beginning of the war. Nor did it tell less on the native
mind, because two English officers had alone appeared to be directly
opposed to the might of Russia; while the whole English Army
along the frontier had remained intact, and had not had occasion
to put forth its strength.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>GENERAL EFFECTS OF THE WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In order to explain our negotiations with France, it is necessary
to give an account of the fate of the Australian expedition
against New Caledonia. The French, fully aware that the expedition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>had been tardily sanctioned from home, and forewarned by
the noisy preparations which had preceded its departure, had
ordered a powerful fleet, gathered from all quarters of the Indian
and Pacific Oceans, to rendezvous in the neighbourhood of New
Caledonia. The force thus gathered was so superior to any
which the colonists could muster that, in order to avoid being
simply blown out of the water, the expedition had to beat an
ignominious retreat. It was a first point in the negotiations with
France for the Home Government to secure arrangements in
reference to Caledonia satisfactory to the Australian colonists.
Indeed, so far as we were concerned, the restoration of Sierra
Leone, and a final and definite settlement of the Newfoundland
Question, were all that we had to demand in addition to this
settlement of the Colonial question.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the balanced condition of affairs as between Germany and
France, it was obvious that no very material change of frontier
was likely to be made. Germany had no disposition to yield any
of the Reichsland; France was in no position to demand it. Things
on that frontier, therefore, remained very much as they had been,
with just this difference, that France, no longer able to count upon
the support of a baffled and impoverished Russia, was not likely
to become aggressive for many years to come. A general disarmament
was discussed, and some steps for reducing the armaments
on all sides were actually adopted. But the difficulties in
the way of any general agreement were too great to admit of any
formal stipulation being recorded in the treaty. The final ratifications
have been delayed until quite recently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Germany has already set to work to put right any weak points
in her harness. In England the successes which have attended
our arms have glossed over not a few weak points which have
been detected in our organisation. The army, it is obvious, will
be allowed to lapse again into a condition adapted to mere peace
parading, despite the vigorous protests that were addressed by
Lord Wolseley at the end of the war to the Government, against
the dangers which must attend such a result. The country will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>continue in the belief that everything is for the best in the best
of all possible armies. Prompt reductions in the fleet and army
have been insisted on. These steps have prevented the Central
Powers from entering into an alliance with us for guaranteeing
the peace of Asia and of Europe, for which their experiences of
the value of an effective alliance with England had at first made
them very anxious. How far the future will justify our omission
to secure the peace of the world by taking proper steps to secure
it, it is for the experience of future generations to determine. For
the moment, England has been once more fortunate in the circumstances
under which she entered on the war, in the allies she
found in it, and in that increased strength of her navy for which
a recent awakening to her dangers had prepared the way. The
reserves prepared for her army, despite the most fanatic opposition,
have enabled her to place an effective army in the field.
Fortunately, the war has not tested her resources beyond that
point. One comparatively small, though absolutely great, improvement
has been made. Those complaints as to the character
of our artillery armament, which were ignored during peace-time,
have been enforced by the experience of war. Both the Horse
Artillery and Field Artillery are to be armed in accordance with
war experience, and not on workshop decisions unconnected with
their actual employment and use.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>SIR CHARLES TUPPER ON IMPERIAL DEFENCE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In conversation some months ago with Sir Charles Dilke, he assured
me that he considered the suggestion made in the columns of <cite>Black
and White</cite> by one of the contributors to the ‘Great War of 1892’—that,
in the event of an imbroglio with India, we might carry our
troops by the American continent—one that was open to much argument.
This criticism of Sir Charles Dilke’s I mentioned to Sir Charles
Tupper.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ replied this doughty upholder of Imperial Federation, ‘let
us discuss the whole question, and we will come to Sir Charles’s criticism,
with which I do not at all agree, later on. I was much impressed
by the way in which you fought out your Great War. The case was
presented in a very strong light. Should such a contingency ever
arise, the Canadian Pacific Railway will furnish a most important
service to the Empire in providing a special route to India. As an
alternative route to India under the British flag from end to end, and
bringing England as it does certainly a fortnight nearer to Yokohama
than Suez, it evidently may play a very important part in Imperial
policy and defence. As has been stated in your paper, not only does
the Canadian Pacific furnish a direct line from Quebec on British
territory throughout, but in winter, with the Intercolonial Railway to
Quebec, the service is made from ocean to ocean by a complete line.
It has already been greatly used by the Admiralty. I do not see any
force in Sir Charles Dilke’s argument that mercenaries in the States
could be engaged to render the line impassable in time of war. Of
course we assume we are at peace with the States themselves. We
have not only the fact that the line is as capable of being defended
against attack as any line here in England would be which might be
threatened by dynamiters; but Canada would furnish protection for
the line by large bodies of trained militiamen and mounted police in
the North-Western Provinces; and there would be the further co-operation
of the States in the same direction, just as they came to our
aid in the Fenian raids in Canada, when the States heartily seconded
us. England would have the entire force of Canada to help to make
the protection of the line as complete as it would be between Liverpool
and London. And another point is this: By making a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place d’armes</span></i>
of Esquimault or Vancouver you could send forward at a few weeks’
notice any number of soldiers you required to those two points, and
hold them there at a point as near to India as they are now here, <em>i.e.</em>
within as easy striking distance of India as they are in England going
by Suez. And you may always trust to Canadian loyalty in any
struggle in which England might be engaged.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>‘I am glad to hear that,’ said I, ‘for when I was in Washington
last year I heard much talk of the annexation of Canada by America,
and of the pleasure with which the Canadians themselves would receive
such a measure.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Charles shook his head. ‘I have said repeatedly,’ replied he,
‘that there is no annexation party in Canada, and I say so again. I
mean that out of the 215 members we send to Parliament not one
would be elected if he declared in favour of American annexation.
Mr. Goldwin Smith, with all his ability, has laboured for twelve years
to convince the people of Canada that it is their inevitable destiny to
become part of America. By his pen, with his tongue, and in the
press, he has done all he can to bring this to pass; and at his own
home, Toronto, a highly respectable and popular man holding Mr.
Smith’s views was induced to offer himself as a candidate at a local
election for the Legislature of Ontario, and out of 9000 votes at the
election he only polled 175! No; we are not within even the remotest
distance of an American annexation. How mad it would be! You
do not know what our connection with England really means to us.
Only a short time ago one of the most prominent members of the
United States Government said to me, “The confederation of British
North America under one Government and the construction of the
Canadian Pacific Railway has brought us face to face with a nation.”’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Which leads to another point,’ I replied. ‘Is there no chance of
Canada becoming a nation on her own account?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘My dear sir,’ replied the High Commissioner, ‘Canada has <em>all</em> to
lose and nothing to gain by becoming independent of England. From
being a very important part of the mightiest Empire in the world,
Canada—or Australia either, for the matter of that—would sink at
once, by becoming independent, into a position in which they would
become the easy prey of those who desired to subjugate them. I
would recommend the strengthening by every practicable means of the
bonds that now unite the mother country and the outlying portions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of the Empire. I have proposed in a recent article in the <cite>Nineteenth
Century</cite> that Australasia and South Africa should be each united under
a central Government, as Canada now is, and that these three great
British dominions should be represented in London by a leading
member of the local Cabinet. You have to take things as they are, not
as you might wish them to be. A Parliamentary Federation of the
Empire, by forming an Imperial Parliament, in which all these great
British possessions should be represented, I regard as utterly impracticable,
because it is in antagonism with the constitution of this
country, and also with the constitution of all the autonomous Colonies.
Therefore I contend that the means of drawing closer the bonds
between the Imperial Government and these great possessions must be
found in some mode consistent with the constitution of England and
the self-government now enjoyed by the Colonies. I come to the conclusion
I have suggested, that the representatives of the three great
British dependencies, being members of the Local Governments, should
be made members of the Imperial Privy Council, and thus be brought
into the closest intercourse and communication with Her Majesty’s
Government here in England, and thus be in a position to give the
most hearty and complete co-operation for the defence of the Empire
everywhere. Another mode to which I attach great importance, and
which is quite practicable, is the adoption of a fiscal policy that would
have the effect of placing the Colonies fiscally in a different position as
regards their relations to Great Britain from that occupied by foreign
countries. Such a policy would lead to the elevation of the Colonies
amongst the countries of the world, to their rapid development, and
to a great expansion of trade between the mother country and them.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Ah!’ said I, ‘doesn’t the kernel of the whole question of Imperial
Federation lie in this Customs difficulty? If we were entirely a Free
Trade empire, there would be little or no difficulty in securing Imperial
Federation. The Union of Hearts, it seems to me, must be preceded
by a Union of Pockets.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ replied Sir Charles, ‘there is no reason that I can see why
absolute Free Trade should be adopted, and in fact it is impracticable,
or any objection taken to the adoption of the same policy pursued by
every other country in the world with regard to their Colonies, by
which they place their fiscal relations with them on an entirely
different basis from that on which their relations with foreign
countries stand; thus adding to the strong sentimental tie that binds
mother and child, that still stronger tie of mutual self-interest; and
the day is not far distant when a very powerful agitation will be promoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>by the artisans here in England for the adoption of the policy
that will most expand the trade of England, and promote the interests
of all who are engaged in the manufactures of this country.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Then,’ I interjected, ‘you thereby make the working-man the
ultimate Court of Appeal, and he will decide as to whether Imperial
Federation is to become an accomplished fact or not.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Charles said, ‘Yes; I believe this policy at no distant day will
be sustained by the operatives.’</p>

<p class='c011'>We drifted into other currents of thought, all bearing on the
question how best to promote a true and lasting Federation. I
alluded to a remark made to me some time since by a distinguished
Cabinet Minister on the fatal policy, not to say the gross injustice, of
pitchforking any scion of nobility, whether fitted for the post or not,
into the vice-regal thrones of the Colonies.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ replied Sir Charles, ‘speaking as a Canadian, I can only
say we have been most fortunate. The policy which has been pursued
with us of sending out a Viceroy of Cabinet rank is, I think,
attended with the greatest possible advantages; first, because it forms
a close connection between the Crown and Canada, and after the
period of service is over these gentlemen bring their great Colonial
experience especially to bear here in England in Parliament, and at
the Council, in a manner highly conducive to the interests of Canada.
Canada owes much to the high standing and character and the abilities
of all her governors since it became a united country.’</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AN INTERVIEW WITH THE RIGHT HON. SIR CHARLES DILKE.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>No man in England, few even on the Continent, are better qualified than
Sir Charles Dilke to judge of the merits or demerits of the other articles
which have called forth so much criticism both here and on the Continent.
With him these subjects have been a matter of life-long study; to their
consideration he has devoted all the energies of a singularly clear and
powerful mind. There are few men, even in these days when the
balance of education is so much more even than it used to be in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>past, who have so thoroughly, and from so scientific a point of view,
grasped the great political problems which now confront the thoughtful
men in all civilised nations. The splendid potentialities that lie
within an energetic and resolute Imperialism; the knitting and welding
together of the mother country with her colonies and dependencies,
the accurate knowledge and estimation of the means of attack and
defence that belong respectively to our own country, and to the great
Continental Powers; these and many other of the great questions, a
proper comprehension of which is absolutely essential to every well-trained,
well-furnished statesman, have for many years received from
Sir Charles Dilke the most careful thought and attention. No English
statesmen and few soldiers, even on the Continent, know more of the
relative strength and capacity of foreign armies than this quiet student
and calm observer in Sloane Street.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE RIGHT HON. SIR CHARLES DILKE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>To no better authority, therefore, could the clever and interesting
<em>brochure</em> be submitted for judgment and criticism than Sir Charles.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little older and greyer, a shade more thoughtful and careworn
than when I last saw him some few years ago, upon the occasion of
some political gathering, when he delivered a speech of much brilliance,
and clear, well-defined, consecutive thought, he yet impressed
me as he impressed me then, with a sense of wonderful versatility,
and a plenitude of knowledge of the subject upon which I had come
to talk.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I feel some little hesitation in replying to your request,’ he began,
‘but since the Editor is evidently anxious that I should do so, I will
endeavour to give you my views as briefly and clearly as I can. Mind
you, I don’t think it is either an easy or a gracious task to criticise the
work of the brilliant staff of experts who have fought this Great War.
Any strictures therefore that I may have to offer will deal entirely
with generalities, or with political and military considerations; the
details of the War seem to me to have been admirably carried out;
and nothing else could have been expected, considering who are the
men who have had part in it. Then, too, I feel that the Editor was
justified, when he wanted to make a war, in making a war which lent
itself to literary and dramatic treatment, instead of the war which
might be more natural but less picturesque. One of my criticisms also
goes to the root of the whole matter, and must necessarily seem a little
by the way. It is that we are assured that a Great War ‘will probably
occur in the immediate future.’ I do not think so, and have
indeed, during all the alarms of the last seventeen years, been an
obstinate believer in the probabilities of peace.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In which the writers clearly differ from you, Sir Charles,’ I replied;
‘I was much struck, however, by the clever manner in which they
caused the war to break out in a small, insignificant country like Bulgaria,
and then spread like a prairie fire, till the whole world was in a
blaze. Do you consider that was a good and probable beginning?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Well,’ replied Sir Charles, as he leaned forward and began to
rapidly sketch out a little map of the Continent, to which he made
constant subsequent reference, ‘it was, perhaps, more ingenious than
either scientific or probable. For my own part, I do not believe that
the next great war, when it does come, will arise from events in the
Balkan Peninsula. Of course, Russia can cause a war whenever she
wishes to do so, but I don’t think she does so wish. The writers of
this brochure state that they have striven to make the imaginary conflict
spring from the most likely source of conflicts. They therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>chose Bulgaria, and I think with a good deal of reason from their point
of view. But, for all that, Russia has pursued an adventurous and
indefensible policy with regard to these States, and however irritating
her conduct may have been, she means peace at heart. Therefore it is,
I think, they are wrong.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is quite fair then, Sir Charles, that I should ask you where you
would have applied the match, had you been writing this war?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Quite fair,’ he replied, with a very genial laugh, as he placed his
finger on the Franco-German frontier. ‘The most probable cause of a
war, which I nevertheless think wholly improbable, will be a frontier
incident between Germany and France, exaggerated by the newspapers,
and subject to the difficulty, as between two great Powers of equal
strength and spirit, of making excuses. It is easy for excuses to be
made by one side when there is obvious disparity of strength, and
when that side, whether the stronger or the weaker, does not desire to
face the risks of war; but, as I have pointed out in an article on the
French grand manœuvres of last year, neither side could now make
such efforts for peace as were made by the Emperor William I. a few
years ago, when frontier incidents of the kind to which I allude
occurred.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Very good, Sir Charles, your war would obviously have very
materially differed from ours; but now, given the causes of ours, what
do you think of the strategy supposed?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘There again,’ was the reply of this keen politician, and endeavour
as best I might I could not puzzle him for a single moment, ‘there
again I have a criticism to offer. I cannot see why Russia should
attempt a descent near Varna, when a descent near Constantinople
would so much better suit her purpose. The garrison of Constantinople
is not, numerically speaking, a strong one. It is very deficient
in effective field artillery, and its infantry, numbering perhaps 18,000
men, could not make much of a defence, unsupported as they are by
a real system of land fortification, against a Russian rush from the
Black Sea coast by land, accompanied by another landing on the Asiatic
side, and a vigorous naval attack against the Therapia batteries.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Talking of Turkey, Sir Charles, should we be certain of her as an
ally if France joined Russia, and we supported Germany?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By no means,’ was his emphatic reply; ‘although I grant you
that actual temporary circumstances in the Mediterranean would have
a great bearing on their attitude, the Turks would look to the possibilities
of the moment. If we could terrorise them—yes; if not——’
and here my companion smilingly shook his head.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>‘Was <cite>Black and White</cite> right in sending English troops to Belgium
on the outbreak of a Franco-German war?’ I next asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I think not,’ slowly replied Sir Charles. ‘It is not likely that
public opinion in England would force the British Government to such
a course. And then again,’ he continued, ‘I think the writers wrong
in another important movement. It seems incredible to me that the
Russians should expose themselves to the three defeats which they met
with in your War. It is much more probable, in my opinion, that
when the time comes when they have to fight the battles described,
against the Turks near Erzeroum, and against the Austrians on the
Galician frontier, they will fight without having the young Emperor
William at the same moment in the field against them. They will
fight under conditions which will enable them to clear the Black Sea
coast of the Turks and the Galician plain of the Austrian forces.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And now, Sir Charles, quitting the storied “War of 189—” for a
moment, I would like to ask you a question or two as to the character
of the warfare of the future, the circumstances under which it will be
carried out, the kind of men best suited for it. Smokeless powder
will doubtless revolutionise all past methods of attack and defence,
don’t you think so? Again, who will be the General of the future—the
student Moltke or the dashing Skobeleff; the politician, the
chemist, or the fighter?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Charles laughed outright as he replied: ‘Rather Moltke than
Skobeleff, but not the politician,—and there is no real political soldier
in France, for instance,—nor the chemist, nor the man of genius; but
the cool-headed man, with plenty of force and of physical strength to
stand the five or six days’ battles which will be the result of smokeless
powder; dash won’t go for much. Few realise the changes that will
be brought about by this smokeless powder. For instance, the officers
will inevitably be picked off. The puzzle to me is how in such cases
vast masses of men will be induced to advance without their leaders.’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘And as to the ethical intent of our War?’ I queried, mindful of
the severe strictures passed by worthy, but ultra-timid old ladies
of either sex upon it when its noiseless cannon first disturbed the journalistic
peace of Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Oh,’ said Sir Charles, with an easy laugh, ‘I cannot see how your
articles could do anything but good; certainly they have done no harm—that
is, from a moral point of view; but, as regards certain other
aspects of their teaching, I am not quite so certain. I am afraid that
people will say only, “Here are great experts who give us the victory,”
and will imagine, therefore, whatever you may say, that our state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>preparation must be excellent, and our enormous expenditure upon
defence not thrown away. It should be borne in mind that you have
given us a victory in the Mediterranean by procuring for us an Italian
alliance; but that there is, and always must be, a grave risk of our
having some day to find ourselves at war with France, or with France
and Russia without any European alliance, and on questions which do
not interest Continental Powers. Again, the Poland resuscitation is
prehistoric. If you leave out the aristocracy and a few townspeople,
there is no part of the Russian Empire in which the Russian Government
is less unpopular than in Poland, and no Polish force could be
collected except one composed of nobles and that small middle-class
which really consists of the little nobility. The capture of Sierra
Leone by France was capital, for under the present circumstances it
would be, of course, inevitable, and it is well that attention has been
so ably called to this point, which involves grave risk to the Cape
route. I cannot think, however, that the Canadian Pacific route is
a very safe one to employ, as our enemies, by spending a little money
in sparsely-settled portions of the United States, could easily break up
the line by bands of hired raiders. And here my criticisms come to
an end. But I would like to say again that in my opinion the War as
conceived by your contributors has been admirably carried out. With
few exceptions, the consequences flow well and naturally, and in perfect
logical sequence from the foundation in facts.’</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
